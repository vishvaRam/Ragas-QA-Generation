# **TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS**

v*A mathematician knows how to solve a problem, he can not solve it. – MILNE* v

# **3.1 Introduction**

The word 'trigonometry' is derived from the Greek words '*trigon*' and '*metron*' and it means 'measuring the sides of a triangle'. The subject was originally developed to solve geometric problems involving triangles. It was studied by sea captains for navigation, surveyor to map out the new lands, by engineers and others. Currently, trigonometry is used in many areas such as the science of seismology, designing electric circuits, describing the state of an atom, predicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analysing a musical tone and in many other areas.

In earlier classes, we have studied the trigonometric ratios of acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right

angled triangle. We have also studied the trigonometric identities and application of trigonometric ratios in solving the problems related to heights and distances. In this Chapter, we will generalise the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions and study their properties.

# **3.2 Angles**

Angle is a measure of rotation of a given ray about its initial point. The original ray is

![](_page_0_Figure_12.jpeg)

called the *initial side* and the final position of the ray after rotation is called the *terminal side* of the angle. The point of rotation is called the *vertex*. If the direction of rotation is anticlockwise, the angle is said to be positive and if the direction of rotation is clockwise, then the angle is *negative* (Fig 3.1).

The measure of an angle is the amount of rotation performed to get the terminal side from the initial side. There are several units for measuring angles. The definition of an angle

![](_page_1_Figure_3.jpeg)

suggests a unit, viz. *one complete revolution* from the position of the initial side as indicated in Fig 3.2.

This is often convenient for large angles. For example, we can say that a rapidly spinning wheel is making an angle of say 15 revolution per second. We shall describe two other units of measurement of an angle which are most commonly used, viz. degree measure and radian measure.

**3.2.1** *Degree measure* If a rotation from the initial side to terminal side is th 1 360 of

a revolution, the angle is said to have a measure of one *degree*, written as 1°. A degree is divided into 60 minutes, and a minute is divided into 60 seconds . One sixtieth of a degree is called a *minute*, written as 1′, and one sixtieth of a minute is called a *second*, written as 1″. Thus, 1° = 60′, 1′ = 60″

Some of the angles whose measures are 360°,180°, 270°, 420°, – 30°, – 420° are shown in Fig 3.3.

![](_page_1_Figure_9.jpeg)

**3.2.2** *Radian measure* There is another unit for measurement of an angle, called the *radian* measure. Angle subtended at the centre by an arc of length 1 unit in a unit circle (circle of radius 1 unit) is said to have a measure of 1 radian. In the Fig 3.4(i) to (iv), OA is the initial side and OB is the terminal side. The figures show the

![](_page_2_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Fig 3.4 (i) to (iv)**

We know that the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit is 2π. Thus, one complete revolution of the initial side subtends an angle of 2π radian.

More generally, in a circle of radius *r*, an arc of length *r* will subtend an angle of 1 radian. It is well-known that equal arcs of a circle subtend equal angle at the centre. Since in a circle of radius *r*, an arc of length *r* subtends an angle whose measure is 1 radian, an arc of length *l* will subtend an angle whose measure is *l r* radian. Thus, if in a circle of radius *r*, an arc of length *l* subtends an angle θ radian at the centre, we have

$$
\Theta\_- = \frac{l}{r} \text{ or } \ l = r \text{ } \Theta\_-
$$

#### 46 MATHEMATICS

**3.2.3** *Relation between radian and real numbers* Consider the unit circle with centre O. Let A be any point on the circle. Consider OA as initial side of an angle. Then the length of an arc of the circle will give the radian measure of the angle which the arc will subtend at the centre of the circle. Consider the line PAQ which is tangent to the circle at A. Let the point A represent the real number zero, AP represents positive real number and AQ represents negative real numbers (Fig 3.5). If we rope the line AP in the anticlockwise direction along the circle, and AQ in the clockwise direction, then every real number will correspond to a radian measure and conversely. Thus, radian measures and real numbers can be considered as one and the same.

![](_page_3_Figure_2.jpeg)

**3.2.4** *Relation between degree and radian* Since a circle subtends at the centre an angle whose radian measure is 2π and its degree measure is 360°, it follows that

$$2\pi \text{ radian} = 360^\circ \quad \text{or} \quad \pi \text{ radian} = 180^\circ$$

The above relation enables us to express a radian measure in terms of degree measure and a degree measure in terms of radian measure. Using approximate value

$$\text{of } \pi \text{ as } \frac{\text{'} 2}{\mathcal{T}} \text{, we have}$$

1 radian = 180 *π* ° = 57° 16′ approximately.

Also 1° = *π* <sup>180</sup> radian = 0.01746 radian approximately.

The relation between degree measures and radian measure of some common angles are given in the following table:

| Degree | 30°    | 45°    | 60°    | 90°    | 180° | 270°    | 360° |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------|---------|------|
| Radian | π<br>6 | π<br>4 | π<br>3 | π<br>2 | π    | 3π<br>2 | 2π   |

## **Notational Convention**

Since angles are measured either in degrees or in radians, we adopt the convention that whenever we write angle θ°, we mean the angle whose degree measure is θ and whenever we write angle β, we mean the angle whose radian measure is β.

Note that when an angle is expressed in radians, the word 'radian' is frequently

omitted. Thus, *π π 180 and 45* 4 = ° = ° are written with the understanding that π and *π* 4

are radian measures. Thus, we can say that

$$\text{Radian measure} = \frac{\pi}{180} \times \text{Degree measure}$$

$$\text{Degree measure} = \frac{180}{\pi} \times \text{Radian measure}$$

**Example 1** Convert 40° 20′ into radian measure.

**Solution** We know that 180° = π radian.

$$\text{Hence} \qquad 40^\circ \ 20' \ = 40 \ \frac{1}{3} \text{ degree} \\ \text{e} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{180} \times \frac{121}{3} \text{ radian} \\ \text{o} = \frac{121\pi}{540} \text{ radian} \\ \text{i.e.}$$

Therefore 40° 20′ =

$$x0' = \frac{12\ln\pi}{\text{S40}} \xrightarrow[\text{radian.}]{} $$

**Example 2** Convert 6 radians into degree measure.

$$\begin{aligned} \text{Solution} \quad & \text{We know that } \pi \text{ radians} = (180^{\circ}. \\ \text{Hence} \quad & \text{6 radians} = \frac{180}{\pi} \times 6 \text{ degree} = \frac{1080 \times 7}{22} \text{degree} \\ &= 343 \frac{7}{11} \text{degree} \quad = 343^{\circ} + \frac{7 \times 60}{11} \text{minute} \quad \text{[as 1}^{\circ} = 60^{\circ}] \\ &= 343^{\circ} + 38^{\circ} + \frac{2}{11} \text{ minute} \quad \quad \text{[as 1}^{\circ} = 60^{\circ}] \\ &= 343^{\circ} + 38^{\circ} + 10.9'' \quad = 343^{\circ}38' \text{ 11''} \text{ approximately.} \\ \text{Hence} \quad & \text{6 radians} = 343^{\circ}38' \text{ 11''} \text{ approximately.} \\ \text{Example 3. Find the radius of the circle in which a central angle of } 60^{\circ} \text{ intersects an arc} \end{aligned}$$

$$\text{Example 3} \quad \text{Find the radius of the circle in which a central angle of } 60^{\circ} \text{ intercepts and } \frac{\cdot}{\cdot}$$

$$\text{arc of length 37.4 cm (use } \pi = \frac{22}{7}).$$

**Solution** Here *l* = 37.4 cm and θ = 60° = <sup>60</sup>*π π* radian = 180 3

Hence, by *r* =

$$\begin{aligned} r &= \frac{l}{\theta}, \text{ we have} \\ r &= \frac{37.4 \times 3}{\pi} = \frac{37.4 \times 3 \times 7}{22} = 35.7 \text{ cm} \end{aligned}$$

**Example 4** The minute hand of a watch is 1.5 cm long. How far does its tip move in 40 minutes? (Use π = 3.14).

**Solution** In 60 minutes, the minute hand of a watch completes one revolution. Therefore, in 40 minutes, the minute hand turns through 2 3 of a revolution. Therefore, 2 *θ =* × 360° 3

or 4*π* 3 radian. Hence, the required distance travelled is given by

$$l = r \cdot \theta = 1.5 \times \frac{4\pi}{3} \text{cm} = 2\pi \text{cm} = 2 \times 3, 14 \text{ cm} = 6.28 \text{ cm}.$$

**Example 5** If the arcs of the same lengths in two circles subtend angles 65°and 110° at the centre, find the ratio of their radii.

**Solution** Let *r 1* and *r 2* be the radii of the two circles. Given that

$$\Theta\_{\downarrow} = 6\mathfrak{S}^{\circ} = \frac{\pi}{180} \times 6\mathfrak{S} = \frac{13\pi}{36} \text{ radian}$$

and θ<sup>2</sup> = 110° = *π* 110 180 × = 22*π* <sup>36</sup> radian

Let *l* be the length of each of the arc. Then *l* = *r* 1 θ1 = *r*<sup>2</sup> θ2 , which gives

$$\frac{13\pi}{36} \times r\_1 = \frac{22\pi}{36} \times r\_2, \text{ i.e., } \frac{r\_1}{r\_2} = \frac{22}{13}$$

= 22 : 13.

Hence *r*

# **3.3 Trigonometric Functions**

In earlier classes, we have studied trigonometric ratios for acute angles as the ratio of sides of a right angled triangle. We will now extend the definition of trigonometric ratios to any angle in terms of radian measure and study them as trigonometric functions.

Consider a unit circle with centre at origin of the coordinate axes. Let P (*a, b*) be any point on the circle with angle AOP = *x* radian, i.e., length of arc AP = *x* (Fig 3.6).

We define cos *x* = *a* and sin *x* = *b* Since ∆OMP is a right triangle, we have

OM<sup>2</sup> + MP<sup>2</sup> = OP<sup>2</sup>or *a* 2 + *b* 2 = 1 Thus, for every point on the unit circle, we have

*a 2* + *b <sup>2</sup>*= 1 or cos<sup>2</sup>*x* + sin<sup>2</sup>*x* = 1

Since one complete revolution subtends an angle of 2π radian at the

centre of the circle, ∠AOB = *π* 2

![](_page_6_Figure_18.jpeg)

∠AOC = π and ∠AOD = 3*π* 2 . All angles which are integral multiples of *π* 2 are called *quadrantal angles*. The coordinates of the points A, B, C and D are, respectively, (1, 0), (0, 1), (–1, 0) and (0, –1). Therefore, for quadrantal angles, we have

$$\begin{aligned} \cos 0^\circ &= 1 & \sin 0^\circ &= 0, \\ \cos \frac{\pi}{2} &= 0 & \sin \frac{\pi}{2} &= 1 \\ \cos \pi &= -1 & \sin \pi &= 0 \\ \cos \frac{3\pi}{2} &= 0 & \sin \frac{3\pi}{2} &= -1 \\ \cos 2\pi &= 1 & \sin 2\pi &= 0 \end{aligned}$$

Now, if we take one complete revolution from the point P, we again come back to same point P. Thus, we also observe that if *x* increases (or decreases) by any integral multiple of *2*π, the values of sine and cosine functions do not change. Thus,

sin (2*n*π + *x*) = sin *x*, *n* ∈ **Z** , cos (2*n*π + *x*) = cos *x* , *n* ∈ **Z** Further, sin *x* = 0, if *x* = 0, ± π, ± 2π , ± 3π, ..., i.e., when *x* is an integral multiple of π and cos *x* = 0, if *x* = ± *π* 2 , ± 3*π* 2 , ± 5*π* 2 , ... i.e., cos *x* vanishes when *x* is an odd multiple of *π* 2 . Thus

**sin** *x* **= 0 implies** *x* **=** *n*π, where *n* is any integer

$$\cos \ x = 0 \text{ implies } x = \left(2n + 1\right)\frac{\pi}{2}, \text{ where } n \text{ is any integer.}$$

We now define other trigonometric functions in terms of sine and cosine functions:

$$\cos \text{sec} \,\text{x} = \frac{1}{\sin \,\text{x}}, \text{ x} \neq \text{ } n\pi, \text{ where } n \text{ is any integer.}$$

$$\sec \,\text{x} = \frac{1}{\cos \,\text{x}}, \text{ x} \neq (2n+1)\,\frac{\pi}{2}, \text{ where } n \text{ is any integer.}$$

$$\tan \,\text{x} = \frac{\sin \,\text{x}}{\cos \,\text{x}}, \text{ x} \neq (2n+1)\,\frac{\pi}{2}, \text{ where } n \text{ is any integer.}$$

$$\cot \,\text{x} = \frac{\cos \,\text{x}}{\sin \,\text{x}}, \text{ x} \neq n \text{ } \pi, \text{ where } n \text{ is any integer.}$$

We have shown that for all real *x*, sin<sup>2</sup>*x* + cos<sup>2</sup>*x* = 1

It follows that

$$1 + \tan^2 \mathfrak{x} = \sec^2 \mathfrak{x} \qquad\qquad\text{(why?)}$$

$$1 + \cot^2 x = \text{cosec}^2 x \qquad \text{(why?)}$$

In earlier classes, we have discussed the values of trigonometric ratios for 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90°. The values of trigonometric functions for these angles are same as that of trigonometric ratios studied in earlier classes. Thus, we have the following table:

|     | 0° | π<br>6 | π<br>4 | π<br>3 | π<br>2         | π   | 3π<br>2        | 2π |
|-----|----|--------|--------|--------|----------------|-----|----------------|----|
| sin | 0  | 1<br>2 | 1<br>2 | 3<br>2 | 1              | 0   | – 1            | 0  |
| cos | 1  | 3<br>2 | 1<br>2 | 1<br>2 | 0              | – 1 | 0              | 1  |
| tan | 0  | 1<br>3 | 1      | 3      | not<br>defined | 0   | not<br>defined | 0  |

The values of cosec *x*, sec *x* and cot *x* are the reciprocal of the values of sin *x*, cos *x* and tan *x*, respectively.

# **3.3.1** *Sign of trigonometric functions*

Let P (*a, b*) be a point on the unit circle with centre at the origin such that ∠AOP = *x*. If ∠AOQ = – *x*, then the coordinates of the point Q will be (*a*, –*b*) (Fig 3.7). Therefore

cos (– *x*) = cos *x*

and sin (– *x*) = – sin *x*

Since for every point P (*a, b*) on the unit circle, – 1 ≤ *a* ≤ 1 and **Fig 3.7**

![](_page_8_Figure_13.jpeg)

– 1 ≤ *b* ≤ 1, we have – 1 ≤ cos *x* ≤ 1 and –1 ≤ sin *x* ≤ 1 for all *x*. We have learnt in previous classes that in the first quadrant (0 < *x* < *π* 2 ) *a* and *b* are both positive, in the second quadrant ( *π* 2 < *x* <π) *a* is negative and *b* is positive, in the third quadrant (π < *x* < 3*π* 2 ) *a* and *b* are both negative and in the fourth quadrant ( 3*π* 2 < *x* < 2π) *a* is positive and *b* is negative. Therefore, sin *x* is positive for 0 < *x* < π, and negative for π < *x* < 2π. Similarly, cos *x* is positive for 0 < *x* < *π* 2 , negative for *π* 2 < *x* < 3*π* 2 and also positive for 3*π* 2 < *x* < 2π. Likewise, we can find the signs of other trigonometric

|         | I | II | III | IV |

| sin x   | + | +  | –   | –  |
| cos x   | + | –  | –   | +  |

| cosec x | + | +  | –   | –  |
| sec x   | + | –  | –   | +  |
| cot x   | + | –  | +   | –  |

functions in different quadrants. In fact, we have the following table.

**3.3.2** *Domain and range of trigonometric functions* From the definition of sine and cosine functions, we observe that they are defined for all real numbers. Further, we observe that for each real number *x*,

– 1 ≤ sin *x* ≤ 1 and – 1 ≤ cos *x* ≤ 1

Thus, domain of *y* = sin *x* and *y* = cos *x* is the set of all real numbers and range is the interval [–1, 1], i.e., – 1 ≤ *y* ≤ 1.

Since cosec *x* = 1 sin *x* , the domain of *y* = cosec *x* is the set { *x* : *x* ∈ **R** and *x* ≠ *n* π, *n* ∈ **Z**} and range is the set {*y* : *y* ∈ **R**, *y* ≥ 1 or *y* ≤ – 1}. Similarly, the domain of *y* = sec *x* is the set {*x* : *x* ∈ **R** and *x* ≠ (2*n* + 1) *π* 2 , *n* ∈ **Z**} and range is the set {*y* : *y* ∈ **R**, *y* ≤ – 1or *y* ≥ 1}. The domain of *y* = tan *x* is the set {*x* : *x* ∈ **R** and *x* ≠ (2*n* + 1) *π* 2 , *n* ∈ **Z**} and range is the set of all real numbers. The domain of *y* = cot *x* is the set {*x* : *x* ∈ **R** and *x* ≠ *n* π, *n* ∈ **Z**} and the range is the set of all real numbers.

We further observe that in the first quadrant, as *x* increases from 0 to *π* 2 , sin *x* increases from 0 to 1, as *x* increases from *π* 2 to π, sin *x* decreases from 1 to 0. In the third quadrant, as *x* increases from π to 3*π* 2 , sin *x* decreases from 0 to –1and finally, in the fourth quadrant, sin *x* increases from –1 to 0 as *x* increases from 3*π* 2 to 2π. Similarly, we can discuss the behaviour of other trigonometric functions. In fact, we have the following table:

|       | I quadrant            | II quadrant             | III quadrant           | IV quadrant            |
|-------|-----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| sin   | increases from 0 to 1 | decreases from 1 to 0   | decreases from 0 to –1 | increases from –1 to 0 |
| cos   | decreases from 1 to 0 | decreases from 0 to – 1 | increases from –1 to 0 | increases from 0 to 1  |
| tan   | increases from 0 to ∞ | increases from –∞to 0   | increases from 0 to ∞  | increases from –∞to 0  |
| cot   | decreases from ∞ to 0 | decreases from 0 to–∞   | decreases from ∞ to 0  | decreases from 0to –∞  |
| sec   | increases from 1 to ∞ | increases from –∞to–1   | decreases from –1to–∞  | decreases from ∞ to 1  |
| cosec | decreases from ∞ to 1 | increases from 1 to ∞   | increases from –∞to–1  | decreases from–1to–∞   |

*Remark* In the above table, the statement tan *x* increases from 0 to ∞ (infinity) for 0 < *x* < *π* 2 simply means that tan *x* increases as *x* increases for 0 < *x* < *π* 2 and assumes arbitraily large positive values as *x* approaches to *π* 2 . Similarly, to say that cosec *x* decreases from –1 to – ∞ (minus infinity) in the fourth quadrant means that cosec *x* decreases for *x* ∈ ( 3*π* 2 , 2π) and assumes arbitrarily large negative values as *x* approaches to 2π. The symbols ∞ and – ∞ simply specify certain types of behaviour of functions and variables.

We have already seen that values of sin *x* and cos *x* repeats after an interval of 2π. Hence, values of cosec *x* and sec *x* will also repeat after an interval of 2π. We

![](_page_11_Figure_3.jpeg)

![](_page_12_Figure_1.jpeg)

shall see in the next section that tan (π + *x*) = tan *x*. Hence, values of tan *x* will repeat after an interval of π. Since cot *x* is reciprocal of tan *x*, its values will also repeat after an interval of π. Using this knowledge and behaviour of trigonometic functions, we can sketch the graph of these functions. The graph of these functions are given above:

**Example 6** If cos *x* = – 3 5 , *x* lies in the third quadrant, find the values of other five trigonometric functions.

**Solution** Since cos *x* = 3 5 − , we have sec *x* = 5 3 − Now sin<sup>2</sup>*x* + cos<sup>2</sup>*x* = 1, i.e., sin<sup>2</sup>*x* = 1 – cos<sup>2</sup>*x*

or sin<sup>2</sup>*x* = 1 – 9 25 = 16 25

> 4 5

Hence sin *x* = ±

Since *x* lies in third quadrant, sin *x* is negative. Therefore

$$\sin x = -\frac{4}{5}$$

which also gives

$$\text{cosec } \mathfrak{x} = -\frac{\mathfrak{s}}{4}$$

#### 56 MATHEMATICS

Further, we have

$$
\tan x = \frac{\cdot}{\cos x} = \frac{4}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad \cot x = \frac{\cdot}{\sin x} = \frac{3}{4} \dots
$$

**Example 7** If cot *x* = – 5 <sup>12</sup> , *x* lies in second quadrant, find the values of other five trigonometric functions.

$$\text{Solution} \quad \text{Since } \cot x = -\frac{\mathfrak{F}}{12} \text{, we have } \tan x = -\frac{12}{\mathfrak{F}}$$

$$\text{Now } \qquad \sec^2 \alpha = 1 + \tan^2 \alpha = 1 + \frac{144}{25} = \frac{169}{25}$$

13 5

Hence sec *x* = ±

Since *x* lies in second quadrant, sec *x* will be negative. Therefore

$$\sec x = -\frac{13}{5}, \frac{1}{5}$$

which also gives

$$\cos x = -\frac{\mathfrak{S}}{13}$$

Further, we have

$$
\sin x = \tan x \cos x = (-\frac{12}{5}) \times (-\frac{5}{13}) = \frac{12}{13}
$$

$$\begin{array}{ccc} \text{and} & \stackrel{\text{cossec}}{\iff} \begin{array}{c} \text{cases} = \stackrel{\text{cossec}}{\sin x} = \stackrel{\text{cossec}}{12} . \end{array} . \\ \\_ \end{array}$$

**Example 8** Find the value of sin 31*π* 3 .

**Solution** We know that values of sin *x* repeats after an interval of 2π. Therefore

$$\sin^{-1}\frac{31\pi}{3} = \sin\left(10\pi + \frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sin\frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\dots$$

**Example 9** Find the value of cos (–1710°).

**Solution** We know that values of cos *x* repeats after an interval of 2π or 360°. Therefore, cos (–1710°) = cos (–1710° + 5 × 360°) = cos (–1710° + 1800°) = cos 90° = 0.

# **3.4 Trigonometric Functions of Sum and Difference of Two Angles**

Consider the unit circle with centre at the origin. Let *x* be the angle P4OP<sup>1</sup> and *y* be the angle P1OP<sup>2</sup> . Then (*x* + *y*) is the angle P4OP<sup>2</sup> . Also let (– *y*) be the angle P4OP<sup>3</sup> . Therefore, P<sup>1</sup> , P<sup>2</sup> , P<sup>3</sup> and P<sup>4</sup> will have the coordinates P<sup>1</sup> (cos *x*, sin *x*), P2 [cos (*x* + *y*), sin (*x* + *y*)], P3 [cos (– *y*), sin (– *y*)] and P<sup>4</sup> (1, 0) (Fig 3.14).

**Fig 3.14**

Consider the triangles P1OP<sup>3</sup> and P2OP<sup>4</sup> . They are congruent (Why?). Therefore, P1 P3 and P<sup>2</sup> P4 are equal. By using distance formula, we get

$$\begin{aligned} \mathbf{P}\_1 \mathbf{P}\_3^{-2} &= [\cos x - \cos (-y)]^2 + [\sin x - \sin (-y)]^2 \\ &= (\cos x - \cos y)^2 + (\sin x + \sin y)^2 \\ &= \cos^2 x + \cos^2 y - 2\cos x \cos y + \sin^2 x + \sin^2 y + 2\sin x \sin y \end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned} \text{Also,} \quad \mathbf{P}\_2 \mathbf{P}\_4^{-2} &= [1 - \cos \left( x + y \right)]^2 + [0 - \sin \left( x + y \right)]^2 \\ &= 1 - 2\cos \left( x + y \right) + \cos^2 \left( x + y \right) + \sin^2 \left( x + y \right) \\ &= 2 - 2\cos \left( x + y \right) \end{aligned}$$

Since P<sup>1</sup> P3 = P<sup>2</sup> P4 , we have P<sup>1</sup> P3 2 = P<sup>2</sup> P4 2 . Therefore, 2 –2 (cos *x* cos *y* – sin *x* sin *y*) = 2 – 2 cos (*x* + *y*). Hence cos (*x* + *y*) = cos *x* cos *y* – sin *x* sin *y* **4 . cos (***x – y***)** *=* **cos** *x* **cos** *y +* **sin** *x* **sin** *y* Replacing *y* by – *y* in identity 3, we get cos (*x* + (– *y*)) = cos *x* cos (– *y*) – sin *x* sin (*– y*) or cos (*x* – *y*) = cos *x* cos *y* + sin *x* sin *y* **5. cos (** *x π* **– 2 )** *=* **sin** *x* If we replace *x* by *π* 2 and *y* by *x* in Identity (4), we get cos ( *π* 2 − *x* ) = cos *π* 2 cos *x* + sin *π* 2 sin *x* = sin *x*. **6. sin (** *x π* **– 2 ) = cos** *x* Using the Identity 5, we have

$$\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \infty\right) = \cos\left[\frac{\pi}{2} - \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \infty\right)\right] = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$$

**7. sin (***x* **+** *y***) = sin** *x* **cos** *y* **+ cos** *x* **sin** *y* We know that

$$\begin{aligned} \sin\left(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y}\right) &= \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - (\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y})\right) = \cos\left(\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \mathbf{x}\right) - \mathbf{y}\right) \\ &= \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \mathbf{x}\right)\cos\left(\mathbf{y} + \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \mathbf{x}\right)\sin\mathbf{y}\right) \\ &\dots \end{aligned}$$

= sin *x* cos *y* + cos *x* sin *y*

**8. sin (***x* **–** *y***) = sin** *x* **cos** *y* **– cos** *x* **sin** *y*

If we replace *y* by –*y*, in the Identity 7, we get the result.

- **9.** By taking suitable values of *x* and *y* in the identities 3, 4, 7 and 8, we get the following results:
	- **cos** *x π* **( + ) 2 = – sin** *x* **sin** *x π* **( + ) 2 = cos** *x* **cos (**π **–** *x***) = – cos** *x* **sin (**π **–** *x***) = sin** *x*

60 MATHEMATICS

**cos (**π **+** *x***) = – cos** *x* **sin (**π **+** *x***) = – sin** *x* **cos (2**π **–** *x***) = cos** *x* **sin (2**π **–** *x***) = – sin** *x*

Similar results for tan *x*, cot *x*, sec *x* and cosec *x* can be obtained from the results of sin *x* and cos *x*.

#### **10. If none of the angles** *x***,** *y* **and (***x* **+** *y***) is an odd multiple of**  *π* 2 **, then**

$$
\tan\left(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y}\right) = \frac{\tan\left|\mathbf{x} + \tan\left|\mathbf{y}\right|\right|}{1 - \tan\left|\mathbf{x}\right|\tan\left|\mathbf{y}\right|}
$$

Since none of the *x*, *y* and (*x* + *y*) is an odd multiple of *π* 2 , it follows that cos *x*, cos *y* and cos (*x* + *y*) are non-zero. Now

$$\tan\left(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y}\right) \,\, = \frac{\sin(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y})}{\cos(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y})} = \frac{\sin\mathbf{x}\cos\mathbf{y} + \cos\mathbf{x}\sin\mathbf{y}}{\cos\mathbf{x}\cos\mathbf{y} - \sin\mathbf{x}\sin\mathbf{y}}.$$

Dividing numerator and denominator by cos *x* cos *y*, we have

$$\tan\left(x+y\right) = \frac{\frac{\sin x \cos y}{\cos x \cos y} + \frac{\cos x \sin y}{\cos x \cos y}}{\frac{\cos x \cos y}{\cos x \cos y} - \frac{\sin x \sin y}{\cos x \cos y}}$$

$$= \frac{\tan x + \tan y}{1 - \tan x \tan y}$$

$$\begin{aligned} \text{11.} \qquad \tan^{-1}(x+y) = \frac{\tan x - \tan y}{1^\circ + \tan x \tan y}, \end{aligned}$$

If we replace *y* by – *y* in Identity 10, we get

$$\begin{aligned} \tan\left(\chi - \chi\right) &= \tan\left[\chi + (-\chi)\right] \\ &= \frac{\tan\chi + \tan\left(-\chi\right)}{1 - \tan\chi \tan\left(-\chi\right)} = \frac{\tan\chi - \tan\chi}{1 + \tan\chi \tan\chi} \end{aligned}$$

**12. If none of the angles** *x***,** *y* **and (***x* **+** *y***) is a multiple of** π**, then**

$$
\cot\left(\left(x+y\right) = \frac{\cot x \cot y - 1}{\cot y + \cot x}\right)
$$

Since, none of the *x*, *y* and (*x* + *y*) is multiple of π, we find that sin *x* sin *y* and sin (*x* + *y*) are non-zero. Now,

$$\cot\left(\left(\chi+\chi\right)\right) = \frac{\cos\left(\chi+\chi\right)}{\sin\left(\chi+\chi\right)} = \frac{\cos\left(\chi\right)\cos\left(\chi-\sin\chi\sin\chi\right)}{\sin\left(\chi\cos\chi+\cos\chi\sin\chi\right)}$$

Dividing numerator and denominator by sin *x* sin *y*, we have

$$
\cot\left(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y}\right) = \frac{\cot\mathbf{x}\cot\mathbf{y} - 1}{\cot\mathbf{y} + \cot\mathbf{x}}
$$

**13. cot (***x* **–** *y***)=** *x y y x* **cot cot +1 cot – cot** if none of angles *x, y* and *x–y* is a multiple of π

If we replace *y* by –*y* in identity 12, we get the result

$$14. \quad \cos 2x \; = \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x = 2\cos^2 x - 1 \\
\neq \left(1 - 2\sin^2 x \right) \left( \frac{1 - \tan^2 x}{1 + \tan^2 x} \right)$$

We know that

$$\begin{array}{l} \cos \left( x + y \right) = \cos x \quad \cos y - \sin x \sin y \\ \text{Replacing } y \text{ by } x \text{, we get} \\ \cos 2x = \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x \\ = \cos^2 x - (1 - \cos^2 x) = 2\cos^2 x - 1 \\ \text{Again,} \quad \cos 2x = \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x \\ = 1 - \sin^2 x - \sin^2 x = 1 - 2\sin^2 x. \\ \quad \boxed{\quad \quad \quad \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x.} \end{array}$$

We have cos 2*x* = cos<sup>2</sup> *x* – sin <sup>2</sup> *x* = 2 2 cos sin cos sin *x x x x* − +

Dividing numerator and denominator by cos<sup>2</sup> *x*, we get

$$\cos 2x = \frac{1 - \tan^2 x}{1 + \tan^2 x}, \quad x \neq n\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}, \text{ where } n \text{ is an integer}$$

**15. sin 2***x* **= 2 sin***x* **cos** *x* **=**  *x x* **2 2tan 1 + tan** *π π* 2 *x n* ≠ + *,* where n is an integer

We have

$$
\sin\left(\chi + \chi\right) = \sin\left(\chi\cos\left\{\nu + \cos\left\{\nu\right\}\right\}\right)
$$

Replacing *y* by *x*, we get sin 2*x* = 2 sin *x* cos *x*.

Again sin 2*x* = 2 2 2sin cos cos sin *x x x x* +

#### 62 MATHEMATICS

Dividing each term by cos<sup>2</sup> *x*, we get

$$\sin \, \mathfrak{L}x = \frac{2 \tan x}{\text{l} + \tan^2 x}$$

$$1.6. \quad \tan 2\pi = \frac{2\tan \pi}{1-\tan^2 \pi} \quad \text{if } 2\pi \neq n\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}, \text{ where } n \text{ is an integer}$$

We know that

$$\tan\left(\left(x+y\right)\right) = \frac{\tan x + \tan y}{1 - \tan x \tan y}$$

Replacing *y* by *x* , we get <sup>2</sup> 2 tan tan 2 1 tan *x x x* = −

# **17. sin 3***x* **= 3 sin** *x* **– 4 sin3** *x*

We have,

sin 3*x* = sin (2*x* + *x*) = sin 2*x* cos *x* + cos 2*x* sin *x* = 2 sin *x* cos *x* cos *x* + (1 – 2sin<sup>2</sup> *x*) sin *x* = 2 sin *x* (1 – sin<sup>2</sup> *x*) + sin *x* – 2 sin<sup>3</sup> *x* = 2 sin *x* – 2 sin<sup>3</sup> *x* + sin *x* – 2 sin<sup>3</sup> *x* = 3 sin *x* – 4 sin<sup>3</sup> *x*

# **18. cos 3***x***= 4 cos<sup>3</sup>** *x* **– 3 cos** *x*

We have,

 cos 3*x* = cos (2*x* +*x*) = cos 2*x* cos *x* – sin 2*x* sin *x* = (2cos<sup>2</sup> *x* – 1) cos *x* – 2sin *x* cos *x* sin *x* = (2cos<sup>2</sup> *x* – 1) cos *x* – 2cos *x* (1 – cos<sup>2</sup> *x*) = 2cos<sup>3</sup> *x* – cos *x* – 2cos *x* + 2 cos<sup>3</sup> *x* = 4cos<sup>3</sup> *x* – 3cos *x*.

$$\text{1.9. } \quad \tan \mathbf{3} \,\,\mathbf{x} = \frac{\mathbf{3} \cdot \tan \mathbf{x} - \tan^3 \mathbf{x}}{\mathbf{1} - \mathbf{3} \tan^2 \mathbf{x}} \quad \text{if } \,\mathbf{3} \,\,\pi \neq n \,\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}, \text{ where } n \text{ is an integer}$$

We have tan 3*x* =tan (2*x* + *x*)

$$=\frac{\tan 2x + \tan x}{1 - \tan 2x \tan x} = \frac{\frac{2 \tan x}{1 - \tan^2 x} + \tan x}{1 - \frac{2 \tan x \cdot \tan x}{1 - \tan^2 x}}$$

$$=\frac{2\tan x + \tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - \tan^2 x - 2\tan^2 x} = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}$$

$$20.\quad(i) \quad \cos x + \cos y = 2\cos\frac{x+y}{2}\cos\frac{x-y}{2}$$

$$\text{(ii)} \quad \cos x - \cos y = -2\sin\frac{x+y}{2}\sin\frac{x-y}{2}$$

$$\text{(iii)} \quad \sin x + \sin y = 2\sin\frac{x+y}{2}\cos\frac{x-y}{2}$$

$$\text{(iv)} \quad \sin x - \sin y = 2\cos\frac{x+y}{2}\sin\frac{x-y}{2}$$

$$\text{We know that}$$

$$\cos\left(x + y\right) = \cos x \cos y - \sin x \sin y$$

$$\text{and } \quad \cos\left(x - y\right) = \cos x \times \cos y + \sin x \sin y$$

$$\text{And } \quad \cos\left(x + y\right) = \cos x \times \cos y + \sin x \sin y$$

$$\implies \cos\left(x + y\right) + \cos(x - y) = 2\cos x \cos y$$

$$\text{and } \quad \cos\left(x + y\right) - \cos\left(x - y\right) = -2\sin x \sin y \qquad \dots(4)$$

$$\text{Further } \quad \sin\left(x + y\right) = \sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y \qquad \dots(5)$$

$$\text{Further } \sin\left(x + y\right) = \sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y \qquad \dots(6)$$

$$\text{Adding and subtracting } (5) \text{ and (6), we get}$$

$$\sin\left(x + y\right) + \sin\left(x - y\right) = 2\sin x \cos y \qquad \dots(7)$$

$$\text{Let } x + y = \sin 0 \implies x = \sin 1 - y \qquad \dots \text{ Therefore }$$

$$\mathbf{x} = \left(\frac{\theta + \phi}{2}\right) \text{and } \mathbf{y} = \left(\frac{\theta - \phi}{2}\right)^2$$

Substituting the values of *x* and *y* in (3), (4), (7) and (8), we get

$$
\cos \theta + \cos \phi = 2 \cos \left(\frac{\theta + \phi}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\theta - \phi}{2}\right)
$$

$$
\cos \theta - \cos \phi = -2 \sin \left(\frac{\theta + \phi}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{\theta - \phi}{2}\right)
$$

$$
\sin \theta + \sin \phi = 2 \sin \left(\frac{\theta + \phi}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\theta - \phi}{2}\right)
$$

$$
\sin \Theta - \sin \phi = 2 \cos \left(\frac{\theta + \phi}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{\theta - \phi}{2}\right)
$$

Since θ and φ can take any real values, we can replace θ by *x* and φ by *y*. Thus, we get

$$\begin{aligned} \cos x + \cos y &= 2 \cos \frac{x+y}{2} \cos \frac{x-y}{2}; \cos x - \cos y = -2 \sin \frac{x+y}{2} \sin \frac{x-y}{2}, \\\ \sin x + \sin y &= 2 \sin \frac{x+y}{2} \cos \frac{x-y}{2}; \sin x - \sin y = 2 \cos \frac{x+y}{2} \sin \frac{x-y}{2}. \end{aligned}$$

*Remark* As a part of identities given in 20, we can prove the following results:

- **21. (i) 2 cos** *x* **cos** *y* **= cos (***x* **+** *y***) + cos (***x**y***)**
	- **(ii) –2 sin** *x* **sin** *y* **= cos (***x* **+** *y***) cos (***x**y***)**
	- **(iii) 2 sin** *x* **cos** *y* **= sin (***x* **+** *y***) + sin (***x**y***)**
	- **(iv) 2 cos** *x* **sin** *y* **= sin (***x* **+** *y***) sin (***x**y***).**

**Example 10** Prove that

$$3\sin\frac{\pi}{6}\sec\frac{\pi}{3} - 4\sin\frac{5\pi}{6}\cot\frac{\pi}{4} = 1$$

**Solution** We have

$$\begin{aligned} \text{L.H.S.} &= 3 \sin \frac{\pi}{6} \sec \frac{\pi}{3} - 4 \sin \frac{5\pi}{6} \cot \frac{\pi}{4} \\ &= 3 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 2 - 4 \sin \left( \pi - \frac{\pi}{6} \right) \times 1 = 3 - 4 \sin \frac{\pi}{6} \\ &= 3 - 4 \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ (= 1)} = \text{R.H.S.} \end{aligned}$$

**Example 11** Find the value of sin 15°.

$$\begin{aligned} \text{Solution} \quad & \begin{aligned} \text{We have} \\ \sin 15^\circ &= \sin \left( 45^\circ - 30^\circ \right) \\ &= \sin 45^\circ \cos 30^\circ - \cos 45^\circ \sin 30^\circ \end{aligned} $$
 
$$ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{2\sqrt{2}} . $$
 
$$ \text{Example 12 Find the value of } \tan \frac{13\pi}{12}. $$

**Solution** We have

$$\tan^{-1}\frac{13\,\pi}{12} = \tan^{-1}\left(\pi + \frac{\pi}{12}\right) = \tan^{-1}\frac{\pi}{12} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{\pi}{6}\right)$$

$$= \frac{\tan\frac{\pi}{4} - \tan\frac{\pi}{6}}{1 + \tan\frac{\pi}{4}\tan\frac{\pi}{6}} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}{1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = 2 - \sqrt{3}$$

**Example 13** Prove that

$$\frac{\sin(\pi + \mathcal{y})}{\sin(\pi - \mathcal{y})} = \frac{\tan \pi + \tan \mathcal{y}}{\tan \pi - \tan \mathcal{y}} \dots$$

**Solution** We have

$$\text{L.H.S.}\qquad = \frac{\sin\left(\pi + \nu\right)}{\sin\left(\pi - \nu\right)} = \frac{\sin\left(\pi\cos\left y + \cos\left x\sin\left y\right)\right)}{\sin\left(\pi\cos\left y - \cos\left x\right)\sin\left y\right)}$$

Dividing the numerator and denominator by cos *x* cos *y*, we get

$$\frac{\sin\left(\pi+\underline{\chi}\right)}{\sin\left(\pi-\underline{\chi}\right)} = \frac{\tan\left|x+\tan\underline{\chi}\right|}{\tan\left|x-\tan\underline{\chi}\right|}.$$

**Example 14** Show that

$$\tan \ 3 \ \text{x} \ \tan \ 2 \ \text{x} \ \tan \ x \equiv \tan \ 3 \ x \text{ - tan } 2 \ x - \tan \ x$$

**Solution** We know that 3*x* = 2*x* + *x*

Therefore, tan 3*x* = tan (2*x* + *x*)

or

$$\tan 3x = \frac{\tan 2x + \tan x}{1 - \tan 2x \tan x}$$

$$\begin{array}{l}\text{or} & \tan 3\pi - \tan 3\pi \tan 2\pi \tan x = \tan 2\pi + \tan x\\\text{or} & \tan 3\pi - \tan 2\pi - \tan x = \tan 3\pi \tan 2\pi \tan x\\\text{or} & \tan 3\pi \tan 2\pi \tan x = \tan 3\pi - \tan 2\pi - \tan x.\end{array}$$

**Example 15** Prove that

$$
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + x\right) + \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4} - x\right) = \sqrt{2}\,\left[\cos x\right]
$$

**Solution** Using the Identity 20(i), we have

$$\begin{aligned} \text{L.H.S.} \qquad &= \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + x\right) + \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4} - x\right) \\\\ &= 2\cos\left(\frac{\frac{\pi}{4} + x + \frac{\pi}{4} - x}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{\frac{\pi}{4} + x - \left(\frac{\pi}{4} - x\right)}{2}\right) \\\\ &= 2\cos\frac{\pi}{4}\cos x = 2 \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cos x = \sqrt{2}\cos x = \text{R.H.S.} \end{aligned}$$

$$\text{Example 16 Prove that } \begin{array}{c} \cos 7x + \cos 5x = \cot \,\,\forall x \\ \sin 7x - \sin 5x = \end{array}$$

**Solution** Using the Identities 20 (i) and 20 (iv), we get

$$\text{L.H.S.} \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \frac{2\cos\frac{7\mathbf{x} + 5\mathbf{x}}{\sqrt{2}}\cos\frac{7\mathbf{x} - 5\mathbf{x}}{2}}{2\cos\frac{7\mathbf{x}^2 + 5\mathbf{x}^2}{2}\sin\frac{7\mathbf{x} - 5\mathbf{x}}{2}} = \frac{\cos\mathbf{x}}{\sin\mathbf{x}} = \cot\mathbf{x} = \text{R.H.S.}$$

$$\text{Example 17 Prove that} \stackrel{\sim}{=} \frac{\sin \mathfrak{F} \,\mathfrak{x} - 2 \sin \mathfrak{Z} \,\mathfrak{x} + \sin \mathfrak{x}}{\cos \mathfrak{Z} \,\mathfrak{x} - \cos \mathfrak{z}} = \tan \mathfrak{x}$$

**Solution** We have

$$\text{L.H.S.}\_{\circ} = \frac{\sin \mathfrak{L} \,\mathfrak{x} + 2 \sin \mathfrak{z} \,\mathfrak{x} + \sin \mathfrak{x}}{\cos \mathfrak{z} \,\mathfrak{x} - \cos \mathfrak{x}} \,\,\, = \frac{\sin \mathfrak{z} \,\mathfrak{x} + \sin \mathfrak{x} - 2 \sin \mathfrak{z} \,\mathfrak{x}}{\cos \mathfrak{z} \,\mathfrak{x} - \cos \mathfrak{z}}$$

$$=\frac{2\sin 3\,\mathrm{x}\,\cos 2\,\mathrm{x} - 2\sin 3\,\mathrm{x}}{-2\sin 3\,\mathrm{x}\sin 2\,\mathrm{x}} = -\frac{\sin 3\,\mathrm{x}\,(\cos 2\,\mathrm{x} - 1)}{\sin 3\,\mathrm{x}\sin 2\,\mathrm{x}}$$

$$\frac{1-\cos 2x}{\sin 2x} = \frac{2\sin^2 x}{2\sin x \cos x} \text{ = } \tan x \text{ = R.H.S.} $$

## *Miscellaneous Examples*

**Example 18** If sin *x* = 3 5 , cos *y* = − 12 13 , where *x* and *y* both lie in second quadrant, find the value of sin (*x* + *y*).

**Solution** We know that

sin (*x* + *y*) = sin *x* cos *y* + cos *x* sin *y* ... (1)

$$\text{Now } \qquad \cos^2 \mathbf{x} = 1 - \sin^2 \mathbf{x} = 1 - \frac{9}{25} = \frac{16}{25} = \frac{1}{25}$$

Therefore cos *x* = ± 4 5

Since *x* lies in second quadrant, cos *x* is negative.

4 5 .

Hence cos *x* = −

$$\text{Now } \qquad \sin^2 y = 1\\ \widehat{-\cos^2 y} = 1 - \frac{144}{169} = \frac{25}{169}$$

.

i.e. sin *y* = ± 5 13

Since *y* lies in second quadrant, hence sin *y* is positive. Therefore, sin *y* = 5 13 . Substituting the values of sin *x*, sin *y*, cos *x* and cos *y* in (1), we get

$$\sin(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y}) = \frac{3}{5} \times \left( -\frac{12}{13} \right) + \left( -\frac{4}{5} \right) \times \frac{5}{13} \qquad \overset{\cdot}{=} -\frac{36}{65} - \frac{20}{65} = -\frac{56}{65} \dots$$

**Example 19** Prove that

$$
\cos 2x \cos \frac{x}{2} - \cos 3x \cos \frac{9x}{2} = \sin 5x \sin \frac{5x}{2} \dots
$$

**Solution** We have

$$\begin{array}{ll} \text{L.H.S.} &= \frac{1}{2} \left[ 2 \cos 2x \cos \frac{x}{2} - 2 \cos \frac{9x}{2} \cos 3x \right] \\\\ &= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \cos \left( 2x + \frac{x}{2} \right) + \cos \left( 2x - \frac{x}{2} \right) - \cos \left( \frac{9x}{2} + 3x \right) - \cos \left( \frac{9x}{2} - 3x \right) \right] \\\\ &= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \cos \frac{5x}{2} + \cos \frac{3x}{2} - \cos \frac{15x}{2} - \cos \frac{3x}{2} \right] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \cos \frac{5x}{2} - \cos \frac{15x}{2} \right] \\\\ &= \frac{1}{2} \left[ -2 \sin \left\{ \frac{5x}{2} + \frac{15x}{2} \right\} \sin \left\{ \frac{5x}{2} - \frac{15x}{2} \right\} \right] \\\\ &= -\sin 5x \sin \left( -\frac{5x}{2} \right) = \sin 5x \sin \frac{5x}{2} = \text{R.H.S.} \end{array}$$

**Example 20** Find the value of tan *π* 8 .

Therefore *y* =

$$y = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}$$

Since *π* 8 lies in the first quadrant, *y* = tan *π* 8 is positve. Hence *π* tan 2 1 8 = − . **Example 21** If 3 3*π* tan = , *π < <* 4 2 *x x* , find the value of sin *x* 2 , cos *x* 2 and tan *x* 2 . **Solution** Since 3*π π* 2 < <*x* , cos *x* is negative. Also *π 3π* 2 2 4 *x* < < . Therefore, sin *x* 2 is positive and cos *x* 2 is negative. Now sec<sup>2</sup>*x* = 1 + tan<sup>2</sup>*x* = 1 9 16 25 16 + = Therefore cos<sup>2</sup>*x* = 16 25 or cos *x* = 4 5 *–* (Why?) Now 2 2 2 *sin x* = 1 – cos *x* = 1 4 5 9 5 + = . Therefore sin<sup>2</sup> *x* 2 = 9 10 or sin *x* 2 = 3 <sup>10</sup> (Why?) Again 2cos<sup>2</sup> *x* 2 = 1+ cos *x* = 1 4 5 1 5 − = Therefore cos<sup>2</sup> *x* 2 = 1 10 or cos *x* 2 = − 1 10 (Why?)

**Solution** We have

## *Historical Note*

The study of trigonometry was first started in India. The ancient Indian Mathematicians, Aryabhatta (476), Brahmagupta (598), Bhaskara I (600) and Bhaskara II (1114) got important results. All this knowledge first went from India to middle-east and from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian approach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world.

In India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents the main contribution of the *siddhantas* (Sanskrit astronomical works) to the history of mathematics.

Bhaskara I (about 600) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions for angles more than 90°. A sixteenth century Malayalam work *Yuktibhasa* (period) contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for sines or cosines of 18°, 36°, 54°, 72°, etc., are given by Bhaskara II.

The symbols sin–1 *x*, cos–1 *x*, etc., for arc sin *x*, arc cos *x*, etc., were suggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The names of Thales (about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known height, and comparing the ratios:

$$\frac{\text{H}}{\text{S}} = \frac{h}{s} = \tan\left(\text{sun's altitude}\right)$$

Thales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through the proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.
