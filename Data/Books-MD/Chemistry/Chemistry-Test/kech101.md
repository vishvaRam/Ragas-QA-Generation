*Chemistry is the science of molecules and their transformations. It is the science not so much of the one hundred elements but of the infinite variety of molecules that may be built from them.*

*Roald Hoffmann*

Science can be viewed as a continuing human effort to systematise knowledge for describing and understanding nature. You have learnt in your previous classes that we come across diverse substances present in nature and changes in them in daily life. Curd formation from milk, formation of vinegar from sugarcane juice on keeping for prolonged time and rusting of iron are some of the examples of changes which we come across many times. For the sake of convenience, science is sub-divided into various disciplines: chemistry, physics, biology, geology, etc. The branch of science that studies the preparation, properties, structure and reactions of material substances is called chemistry.

### **DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMISTRY**

Chemistry, as we understand it today, is not a very old discipline. Chemistry was not studied for its own sake, rather it came up as a result of search for two interesting things:

*i. Philosopher's stone (Paras)* which would convert all baser metals e.g., iron and copper into gold.

*ii. 'Elixir of life'* which would grant immortality. People in ancient India, already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of modern science. They applied that knowledge in various walks of life. Chemistry developed mainly in the form of Alchemy and Iatrochemistry during 1300-1600 CE. Modern chemistry took shape in the 18th century Europe, after a few centuries of alchemical traditions which were introduced in Europe by the Arabs.

Other cultures – especially the Chinese and the Indian – had their own alchemical traditions. These included much knowledge of chemical processes and techniques.

In ancient India, chemistry was called *Rasayan Shastra, Rastantra, Ras Kriya* or *Rasvidya*. It included metallurgy, medicine, manufacture of cosmetics, glass, dyes, etc. Systematic excavations at Mohenjodaro in Sindh and Harappa in Punjab prove that the story of development of chemistry in India is very old. Archaeological findings show that baked bricks were used in construction work. It shows the mass production of pottery, which can be regarded as the earliest chemical process, in which materials were mixed, moulded and subjected to heat by using fire to achieve desirable qualities. Remains of glazed pottery have been found in Mohenjodaro. Gypsum cement has been used in the construction work. It contains lime, sand and traces of CaCO3. Harappans made faience, a sort of glass which was used in ornaments. They melted and forged a variety of objects from metals, such as lead, silver, gold and copper. They improved the hardness of copper for making artefacts by using tin and arsenic. A number of glass objects were found in Maski in South India (1000–900 BCE), and Hastinapur and Taxila in North India (1000–200 BCE). Glass and glazes were coloured by addition of colouring agents like metal oxides.

Copper metallurgy in India dates back to the beginning of chalcolithic cultures in the subcontinent. There are much archeological evidences to support the view that technologies for extraction of copper and iron were developed indigenously.

According to *Rigveda,* tanning of leather and dying of cotton were practised during 1000–400 BCE. The golden gloss of the black polished ware of northen India could not be replicated and is still a chemical mystery. These wares indicate the mastery with which kiln temperatures could be controlled. Kautilya's *Arthashastra* describes the production of salt from sea.

A vast number of statements and material described in the ancient Vedic literature can be shown to agree with modern scientific findings. Copper utensils, iron, gold, silver ornaments and terracotta discs and painted grey pottery have been found in many archaeological sites in north India. *Sushruta Samhita* explains the importance of Alkalies. The *Charaka Samhita* mentions ancient indians who knew how to prepare sulphuric acid, nitric acid and oxides of copper, tin and zinc; the sulphates of copper, zinc and iron and the carbonates of lead and iron.

*Rasopanishada* describes the preparation of gunpowder mixture. Tamil texts also describe the preparation of fireworks using sulphur, charcoal, saltpetre (i.e., potassium nitrate), mercury, camphor, etc.

Nagarjuna was a great Indian scientist. He was a reputed chemist, an alchemist and a metallurgist. His work *Rasratnakar* deals with the formulation of mercury compounds. He has also discussed methods for the extraction of metals, like gold, silver, tin and copper. A book, *Rsarnavam*, appeared around 800 CE. It discusses the uses of various furnaces, ovens and crucibles for different purposes. It describes methods by which metals could be identified by flame colour.

*Chakrapani* discovered mercury sulphide. The credit for inventing soap also goes to him. He used mustard oil and some alkalies as ingredients for making soap. Indians began making soaps in the 18th century CE. Oil of *Eranda* and seeds of *Mahua* plant and calcium carbonate were used for making soap.

The paintings found on the walls of Ajanta and Ellora, which look fresh even after ages, testify to a high level of science achieved in ancient India. Varähmihir's *Brihat Samhita* is a sort of encyclopaedia, which was composed in the sixth century CE. It informs about the preparation of glutinous material to be applied on walls and roofs of houses and temples. It was prepared entirely from extracts of various plants, fruits, seeds and barks, which were concentrated by boiling, and then, treated with various resins. It will be interesting to test such materials scientifically and assess them for use.

#### Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry 3

A number of classical texts, like *Atharvaveda* (1000 BCE) mention some dye stuff, the material used were turmeric, *madder*, sunflower, orpiment, cochineal and lac. Some other substances having tinting property were *kamplcica, pattanga* and *jatuka*.

Varähmihir's *Brihat Samhita* gives references to perfumes and cosmetics. Recipes for hair dying were made from plants, like indigo and minerals like iron power, black iron or steel and acidic extracts of sour rice gruel. *Gandhayukli* describes recipes for making scents, mouth perfumes, bath powders, incense and talcum power.

Paper was known to India in the 17th century as account of Chinese traveller I-tsing describes. Excavations at Taxila indicate that ink was used in India from the fourth century. Colours of ink were made from chalk, red lead and minimum.

It seems that the process of fermentation was well-known to Indians*.* Vedas and Kautilya's *Arthashastra* mention about many types of liquors. *Charaka Samhita* also mentions ingredients, such as barks of plants, stem, flowers, leaves, woods, cereals, fruits and sugarcane for making *Asavas.*

The concept that matter is ultimately made of indivisible building blocks, appeared in India a few centuries BCE as a part of philosophical speculations. Acharya Kanda, born in 600 BCE, originally known by the name Kashyap, was the first proponent of the 'atomic theory'. He formulated the theory of very small indivisible particles, which he named '*Paramãnu*' (comparable to atoms). He authored the text *Vaiseshika Sutras*. According to him, all substances are aggregated form of smaller units called atoms (*Paramãnu*), which are eternal, indestructible, spherical, suprasensible and in motion in the original state. He explained that this individual entity cannot be sensed through any human organ. Kanda added that there are varieties of atoms that are as different as the different classes of substances. He said these (*Paramãnu*) could form pairs or triplets, among other combinations and unseen forces cause interaction between them. He conceptualised this theory around 2500 years before John Dalton (1766-1844).

*Charaka Samhita* is the oldest Ayurvedic epic of India. It describes the treatment of diseases. The concept of reduction of particle size of metals is clearly discussed in *Charaka Samhita*. Extreme reduction of particle size is termed as nanotechnology. *Charaka Samhita*  describes the use of *bhasma* of metals in the treatment of ailments. Now-a-days, it has been proved that *bhasmas* have nanoparticles of metals.

After the decline of alchemy, Iatrochemistry reached a steady state, but it too declined due to the introduction and practise of western medicinal system in the 20th century. During this period of stagnation, pharmaceutical industry based on Ayurveda continued to exist, but it too declined gradually. It took about 100-150 years for Indians to learn and adopt new techniques. During this time, foreign products poured in. As a result, indigenous traditional techniques gradually declined. Modern science appeared in Indian scene in the later part of the nineteenth century. By the mid-nineteenth century, European scientists started coming to India and modern chemistry started growing.

From the above discussion, you have learnt that chemistry deals with the composition, structure, properties and interection of matter and is of much use to human beings in daily life. These aspects can be best described and understood in terms of basic constituents of matter that are **atoms** and **molecules**. That is why, chemistry is also called the science of atoms and molecules. Can we see, weigh and perceive these entities (atoms and molecules)? Is it possible to count the number of atoms and molecules in a given mass of matter and have a quantitative relationship between the mass and the number of these particles? We will get the answer of some of these questions in this Unit. We will further describe how physical properties of matter can be quantitatively described using numerical values with suitable units.

### **1.1 IMPORTANCE OF CHEMISTRY**

Chemistry plays a central role in science and is often intertwined with other branches of science.

Principles of chemistry are applicable in diverse areas, such as weather patterns, functioning of brain and operation of a computer, production in chemical industries, manufacturing fertilisers, alkalis, acids, salts, dyes, polymers, drugs, soaps, detergents, metals, alloys, etc., including new material.

Chemistry contributes in a big way to the national economy. It also plays an important role in meeting human needs for food, healthcare products and other material aimed at improving the quality of life. This is exemplified by the large-scale production of a variety of fertilisers, improved variety of pesticides and insecticides. Chemistry provides methods for the isolation of lifesaving drugs from natural sources and makes possible synthesis of such drugs. Some of these drugs are **cisplatin** and **taxol**, which are effective in cancer therapy. The drug AZT (Azidothymidine) is used for helping AIDS patients.

Chemistry contributes to a large extent in the development and growth of a nation. With a better understanding of chemical principles it has now become possible to design and synthesise new material having specific magnetic, electric and optical properties. This has lead to the production of superconducting ceramics, conducting polymers, optical fibres, etc. Chemistry has helped in establishing industries which manufacture utility goods, like acids, alkalies, dyes, polymesr metals, etc. These industries contribute in a big way to the economy of a nation and generate employment.

In recent years, chemistry has helped in dealing with some of the pressing aspects of environmental degradation with a fair degree of success. Safer alternatives to environmentally hazardous refrigerants, like CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), responsible for ozone depletion in the stratosphere, have been successfully synthesised. However, many big environmental problems continue to be matters of grave concern to the chemists. One such problem is the management of the Green House gases, like methane, carbon dioxide, etc. Understanding of biochemical processes, use of enzymes for large-scale production of chemicals and synthesis of new exotic material are some of the intellectual challenges for the future generation of chemists. A developing country, like India, needs talented and creative chemists for accepting such challenges. To be a good chemist and to accept such challanges, one needs to understand the basic concepts of chemistry, which begin with the concept of matter. Let us start with the nature of matter.

#### **1.2 Nature of Matter**

You are already familiar with the term **matter** from your earlier classes. Anything which has mass and occupies space is called **matter**. Everything around us, for example, book, pen, pencil, water, air, all living beings, etc., are composed of matter. You know that they have mass and they occupy space. Let us recall the characteristics of the states of matter, which you learnt in your previous classes.

#### **1.2.1 States of Matter**

You are aware that matter can exist in three physical states *viz.* **solid**, **liquid** and **gas**. The constituent particles of matter in these three states can be represented as shown in Fig. 1.1.

Particles are held very close to each other in **solids** in an orderly fashion and there is not much freedom of movement. In **liquids**, the particles are close to each other but they can move around. However, in **gases**, the particles are far apart as compared to those present in solid or liquid states and their movement is easy and fast. Because of such arrangement of particles, different states of matter exhibit the following characteristics:

- (i) Solids have *definite volume* and *definite shape*.
- (ii) Liquids have *definite volume* but *do not* have *definite shape*. They take the shape of the container in which they are placed.

Unit 1.indd 4 9/9/2022 4:27:29 PM

![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

*Fig. 1.2 Classification of matter Fig. 1.1 Arrangement of particles in solid, liquid and gaseous state*

(iii) Gases have *neither definite volume nor definite shape*. They completely occupy the space in the container in which they are placed.

These three states of matter are interconvertible by changing the conditions of temperature and pressure.

Solid liquid Gas

On heating, a solid usually changes to a liquid, and the liquid on further heating changes to gas (or vapour). In the reverse process, a gas on cooling liquifies to the liquid and the liquid on further cooling freezes to the solid.

#### **1.2.2. Classification of Matter**

In Class IX (Chapter 2), you have learnt that at the macroscopic or bulk level, matter can be classified as **mixture** or **pure substance**. These can be further sub-divided as shown in Fig. 1.2.

When all constituent particles of a substance are same in chemical nature, it is said to be a pure substance. A mixture contains many types of particles.

**A mixture** contains particles of two or more pure substances which may be present in it in any ratio. Hence, their composition is variable. Pure substances forming mixture are called its components. Many of the substances present around you are **mixtures**. For example, sugar solution in water, air, tea, etc., are all mixtures. A mixture may be **homogeneous** or **heterogeneous**. In a **homogeneous mixture**, the components

![](_page_4_Figure_11.jpeg)

completely mix with each other. This means particles of components of the mixture are uniformly distributed throughout the bulk of the mixture and its composition is uniform throughout. Sugar solution and air are the examples of homogeneous mixtures. In contrast to this, in a **heterogeneous mixture**, the composition is not uniform throughout and sometimes different components are visible. For example, mixtures of salt and sugar, grains and pulses along with some dirt (often stone pieces), are heterogeneous mixtures. You can think of many more examples of mixtures which you come across in the daily life. It is worthwhile to mention here that the components of a mixture can be separated by using physical methods, such as simple hand-picking, filtration, crystallisation, distillation, etc.

**Pure substances** have characteristics different from mixtures. Constituent particles of pure substances have fixed composition. Copper, silver, gold, water and glucose are some examples of pure substances. Glucose contains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in a fixed ratio and its particles are of same composition. Hence, like all other pure substances, glucose has a fixed composition. Also, its constituents—carbon, hydrogen and oxygen—cannot be separated by simple physical methods.

Pure substances can further be classified into **elements** and **compounds**. Particles of an **element** consist of only one type of atoms. These particles may exist as **atoms** or **molecules**. You may be familiar with atoms

Unit 1.indd 5 9/9/2022 4:27:30 PM

6 chemistry

and molecules from the previous classes; however, you will be studying about them in detail in Unit 2. Sodium, copper, silver, hydrogen, oxygen, etc., are some examples of elements. Their all atoms are of one type. However, the atoms of different elements are different in nature. Some elements, such as sodium or copper, contain atoms as their constituent particles, whereas, in some others, the constituent particles are molecules which are formed by two or more atoms. For example, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen gases consist of molecules, in which two atoms combine to give their respective molecules. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.3.

![](_page_5_Figure_2.jpeg)

*Fig. 1.3 A representation of atoms and molecules*

When two or more atoms of different elements combine together in a definite ratio, the molecule of a **compound** is obtained. Moreover, the constituents of a compound cannot be separated into simpler substances by physical methods. They can be separated by chemical methods. Examples of some compounds are water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, sugar, etc. The molecules of water and carbon dioxide are represented in Fig. 1.4.

Note that a water molecule comprises two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Similarly, a molecule of carbon dioxide contains two oxygen atoms combined with one carbon atom. Thus, the atoms of different

![](_page_5_Figure_6.jpeg)

*Fig. 1.4 A depiction of molecules of water and carbon dioxide*

elements are present in a compound in a fixed and definite ratio and this ratio is characteristic of a particular compound. Also, the properties of a compound are different from those of its constituent elements. For example, hydrogen and oxygen are gases, whereas, the compound formed by their combination i.e., water is a liquid. It is interesting to note that hydrogen burns with a pop sound and oxygen is a supporter of combustion, but water is used as a fire extinguisher.

# **1.3 Properties of Matter and their Measurement**

#### **1.3.1 Physical and chemical properties**

Every substance has unique or characteristic properties. These properties can be classified into two categories — **physical properties,** such as colour, odour, melting point, boiling point, density, etc., and **chemical properties,** like composition, combustibility, ractivity with acids and bases, etc.

**Physical properties** can be measured or observed without changing the identity or the composition of the substance. The measurement or observation of **chemical properties** requires a chemical change to occur. Measurement of physical properties does not require occurance of a chemical change. The examples of chemical properties are characteristic reactions of different substances; these include acidity or basicity, combustibility, etc. Chemists describe, interpret and predict the behaviour of substances on the basis of knowledge of their physical and chemical properties, which are determined by careful measurement and experimentation. In the following section, we

Unit 1.indd 6 9/9/2022 4:27:30 PM

will learn about the measurement of physical properties.

#### **1.3.2 Measurement of physical properties**

Quantitative measurement of properties is reaquired for scientific investigation. Many properties of matter, such as length, area, volume, etc., are quantitative in nature. Any quantitative observation or measurement is represented by a number followed by units in which it is measured. For example, length of a room can be represented as 6 m; here, 6 is the number and m denotes metre, the unit in which the length is measured.

Earlier, two different systems of measurement, i.e., the **English System**  and the **Metric System** were being used in different parts of the world. The metric system, which originated in France in late eighteenth century, was more convenient as it was based on the decimal system. Late, need of a common standard system was felt by the scientific community. Such a system was established in 1960 and is discussed in detail below.

#### **1.3.3 The International System of Units (SI)**

The International System of Units (in French *Le Systeme International d'Unités*  — abbreviated as SI) was established by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM from *Conference Generale des Poids et Measures*). The CGPM is an inter-

#### **Maintaining the National Standards of Measurement**

The system of units, including unit definitions, keeps on changing with time. Whenever the accuracy of measurement of a particular unit was enhanced substantially by adopting new principles, member nations of metre treaty (signed in 1875), agreed to change the formal definition of that unit. Each modern industrialised country, including India, has a National Metrology Institute (NMI), which maintains standards of measurements. This responsibility has been given to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi. This laboratory establishes experiments to realise the *base units* and *derived units* of measurement and maintains National Standards of Measurement. These standards are periodically inter-compared with standards maintained at other National Metrology Institutes in the world, as well as those, established at the International Bureau of Standards in Paris.

governmental treaty organisation created by a diplomatic treaty known as Metre Convention, which was signed in Paris in 1875.

**The SI system has seven** *base units* and they are listed in Table 1.1. These units pertain to the seven fundamental scientific quantities. The other physical quantities, such as speed, volume, density, etc., can be derived from these quantities.

The definitions of the SI base units are given in Table 1.2.

The SI system allows the use of prefixes to indicate the multiples or submultiples of a unit. These prefixes are listed in Table 1.3.

Let us now quickly go through some of the quantities which you will be often using in this book.

This number is the fixed numerical value of the `<br>`Avogadro constant, NA,`<br>`when expressed in the unit mol–1 and `<br>`is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance,`<br>`symbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of specified `<br>`elementary entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a `<br>`molecule, an ion, an electron, any other particle or specified `<br>`group of particles. |
| Unit of luminous `<br>`Intensity                | Candela  | The candela, symbol cd is the SI unit of luminous intensity in `<br>`a given direction. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical `<br>`value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation `<br>`of frequency 540×1012 Hz, Kcd, to be 683 when expressed `<br>`in the unit lm·W–1, which is equal to cd·sr·W–1, or cd sr kg–1 `<br>`m–2s3, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in `<br>`terms of h, c and V Cs.                                                                                                                           |
