This unit covers identifying redox reactions, defining oxidation, reduction, oxidant, and reductant, explaining redox mechanisms via electron transfer, using oxidation numbers to identify oxidants and reductants, classifying redox reactions (combination, decomposition, displacement, disproportionation), ordering reductants and oxidants, and balancing chemical equations using the oxidation number and half-reaction methods.

From our knowledge of chemical bonding we also know that sodium chloride, sodium oxide and sodium sulphide are ionic compounds and perhaps better written as Na+Cl\u2013 (s), (Na+) 2O2\u2013(s), and (Na+) 2 S2\u2013(s). Development of charges on the species produced suggests us to rewrite the reactions (7.12 to 7.14) in the following manner : ![](_page_2_Figure_10.jpeg) For convenience, each of the above processes can be considered as two separate steps, one involving the loss of electrons and the other the gain of electrons.

Sum of the half reactions gives the overall reaction : 2 Na(s) + Cl2 (g) \u2192 2 Na+ Cl\u2013 (s) or 2 NaCl (s) Reactions 7.12 to 7.14 suggest that half reactions that involve loss of electrons are called oxidation reactions. Similarly, the half reactions that involve gain of electrons are called reduction reactions. It may not be out of context to mention here that the new way of defining oxidation and reduction has been achieved only by establishing a correlation between the behaviour of species as per the classical idea and their interplay in electron-transfer change. In reactions (7.12 to 7.14) sodium, which is oxidised, acts as a reducing agent because it donates electron to each of the elements interacting with it and thus helps in reducing them. Chlorine, oxygen and sulphur are reduced and act as oxidising agents because these accept electrons from sodium. To summarise, we may mention that *Oxidation :* Loss of electron(s) by any species. *Reduction :* Gain of electron(s) by any species. *Oxidising agent :* Acceptor of electron(s). *Reducing agent :* Donor of electron(s).

You may notice that the strip becomes coated with reddish metallic copper and the blue colour of the solution disappears. Formation of Zn2+ ions among the products can easily be judged when the blue colour of the solution due to Cu2+ has disappeared. If hydrogen sulphide gas is passed through the colourless solution containing Zn2+ ions, appearance of white zinc sulphide, ZnS can be seen on making the solution alkaline with ammonia. The reaction between metallic zinc and the aqueous solution of copper nitrate is : Zn(s) + Cu2+ (aq) \u2192 Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s) (7.15) In reaction (7.15), zinc has lost electrons to form Zn2+ and, therefore, zinc is oxidised. Evidently, now if zinc is oxidised, releasing electrons, something must be reduced, accepting the electrons lost by zinc. Copper ion is reduced by gaining electrons from the zinc. Reaction (7.15) may be rewritten as : At this stage we may investigate the state of equilibrium for the reaction represented by equation (7.15). For this purpose, let us place a strip of metallic copper in a zinc sulphate solution. No visible reaction is noticed and attempt to detect the presence of Cu2+ ions by passing H2S gas through the solution to produce the black colour of cupric sulphide, CuS, does not succeed. Cupric sulphide has such a low solubility that this is an extremely sensitive test; yet the amount of Cu2+ formed cannot be detected. We thus conclude that the state of equilibrium for the reaction (7.15) greatly favours the products over the reactants. Let us extend electron transfer reaction now to copper metal and silver nitrate solution in water and arrange a set-up as shown in Fig. 7.2. The solution develops blue colour due to the formation of Cu2+ ions on account of the reaction: $$\\begin{array}{c} \\text{release of 2e}^{\\cdot} \\text{ } \\hspace{1cm} \\text{release of 2e}^{\\cdot} \\text{ } \\hspace{1cm} \\text{Cu(s)} + 2\\text{Ag}^{2+} \\text{(aq)} \\xrightarrow{\\cdot} \\text{Cu}^{2+} \\text{(aq)} + 2\\text{Ag(s)}\\\\ \\hspace{1cm} \\text{gain of 2e}^{\\cdot} \\text{ } \\hspace{1cm} \\text{gain of 2e}^{\\cdot} \\text{ } \\hspace{1cm} \\end{array} \\text{(7.16)}$$ Here, Cu(s) is oxidised to Cu2+(aq) and Ag+(aq) is reduced to Ag(s). Equilibrium greatly favours the products Cu2+ (aq) and Ag(s). By way of contrast, let us also compare the reaction of metallic cobalt placed in nickel sulphate solution. The reaction that occurs here is : ![](_page_3_Figure_15.jpeg) *Fig. 7.1 Redox reaction between zinc and aqueous solution of copper nitrate occurring in a beaker.* Unit 7.indd 238 11\/11\/2022 09:48:49 ![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg) *Fig. 7.2 Redox reaction between copper and aqueous solution of silver nitrate occurring in a beaker.* At equilibrium, chemical tests reveal that both Ni2+(aq) and Co2+(aq) are present at moderate concentrations. In this case, neither the reactants [Co(s) and Ni2+(aq)] nor the products [Co2+(aq) and Ni (s)] are greatly favoured.

The solution develops blue colour due to the formation of Cu2+ ions on account of the reaction: $$\\begin{array}{c} \\text{release of 2e}^{\\cdot} \\text{ } \\hspace{1cm} \\text{release of 2e}^{\\cdot} \\text{ } \\hspace{1cm} \\text{Cu(s)} + 2\\text{Ag}^{2+} \\text{(aq)} \\xrightarrow{\\cdot} \\text{Cu}^{2+} \\text{(aq)} + 2\\text{Ag(s)}\\\\ \\hspace{1cm} \\text{gain of 2e}^{\\cdot} \\text{ } \\hspace{1cm} \\text{gain of 2e}^{\\cdot} \\text{ } \\hspace{1cm} \\end{array} \\text{(7.16)}$$ Here, Cu(s) is oxidised to Cu2+(aq) and Ag+(aq) is reduced to Ag(s). Equilibrium greatly favours the products Cu2+ (aq) and Ag(s). By way of contrast, let us also compare the reaction of metallic cobalt placed in nickel sulphate solution. The reaction that occurs here is : ![](_page_3_Figure_15.jpeg) *Fig. 7.1 Redox reaction between zinc and aqueous solution of copper nitrate occurring in a beaker.* Unit 7.indd 238 11\/11\/2022 09:48:49 ![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg) *Fig. 7.2 Redox reaction between copper and aqueous solution of silver nitrate occurring in a beaker.* At equilibrium, chemical tests reveal that both Ni2+(aq) and Co2+(aq) are present at moderate concentrations. In this case, neither the reactants [Co(s) and Ni2+(aq)] nor the products [Co2+(aq) and Ni (s)] are greatly favoured. This competition for release of electrons incidently reminds us of the competition for release of protons"

In this method, it is always assumed that there is a complete transfer of electron from a less electronegative atom to a more electonegative atom. For example, we rewrite equations (7.18 to 7.20) to show charge on each of the atoms forming part of the reaction : $$\\begin{array}{cccc} 0 & 0 & +1 \\ -2 \\\\ 2\\text{H}\\_{2}\\text{(g)} + \\text{O}\\_{2}\\text{(g)} & \\rightarrow & 2\\text{H}\\_{2}\\text{O} \\text{ (l)} \\\\ 0 & 0 & +1 \\ -1 \\end{array} \\tag{7.21}$$ $$\\text{H}\\_2\\text{ (s)} + \\text{Cl}\\_2\\text{(g)} \\rightarrow 2\\text{HCl(g)}\\tag{7.22}$$ \u20134+1 0 +4 \u20131 +1 \u20131 $$\\text{CH}\\_4\\text{(g)}\\, + \\text{4Cl}\\_2\\text{(g)} \\rightarrow \\text{CCl}\\_4\\text{(l)}\\, + \\text{4HCl(g)}\\quad \\text{(7.23)}$$ It may be emphasised that the assumption of electron transfer is made for book-keeping purpose only and it will become obvious at a later stage in this unit that it leads to the simple description of redox reactions. Oxidation number denotes the oxidation state of an element in a compound ascertained according to a set of rules formulated on the basis that electron pair Unit 7.indd 239 11\/10\/2022 15:18:03 # in a covalent bond belongs entirely to more electronegative element. It is not always possible to remember or make out easily in a compound\/ion, which element is more electronegative than the other. Therefore, a set of rules has been formulated to determine the oxidation number of an element in a compound\/ion. If two or more than two atoms of an element are present in the molecule\/ion such as Na2S2O3\/Cr2O7 2\u2013, the oxidation number of the atom of that element will then be the average of the oxidation number of all the atoms of that element. We may at this stage, state the rules for the calculation of oxidation number. These rules are: - 1. In elements, in the free or the uncombined state, each atom bears an oxidation number of zero. Evidently each atom in H2, O2, Cl2, O3, P4, S8, Na, Mg, Al has the oxidation number zero. - 2. For ions composed of only one atom, the oxidation number is equal to the charge on the ion. Thus Na+ ion has an oxidation number of +1, Mg2+ ion, +2, Fe3+ ion, +3, Cl\u2013 ion, \u20131, O2\u2013 ion, \u20132; and so on. In their compounds all alkali metals have oxidation number of +1, and all alkaline earth metals have an oxidation number of +2. Aluminium is regarded to have an oxidation number of +3 in all its compounds. - 3. The oxidation number of oxygen in most compounds is \u20132. However, we come across two kinds of exceptions here. One arises in the case of peroxides and superoxides, the compounds of oxygen in which oxygen atoms are directly linked to each other. While in peroxides (e.g., H2O2, Na2O2), each oxygen atom is assigned an oxidation number of \u20131, in superoxides (e.g., KO2, RbO2) each oxygen atom is assigned an oxidation number of \u2013(\u00bd). The second exception appears rarely, i.e. when oxygen is bonded to fluorine. In such compounds e.g., oxygen difluoride (OF2) and dioxygen difluoride (O2F2), the oxygen is assigned an oxidation number of +2 and +1, respectively. The number assigned to oxygen will depend upon the bonding state of oxygen but this number would now be a positive figure only. - 4. The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1, except when it is bonded to metals in binary compounds (that is compounds containing two elements). For example, in LiH, NaH, and CaH2, its oxidation number is \u20131. - 5. In all its compounds, fluorine has an oxidation number of \u20131. Other halogens (Cl, Br, and I) also have an oxidation number of \u20131, when they occur as halide ions in their compounds. Chlorine, bromine and iodine when combined with oxygen, for example in oxoacids and oxoanions, have positive oxidation numbers. - 6. The algebraic sum of the oxidation number of all the atoms in a compound must be zero. In polyatomic ion, the algebraic sum of all the oxidation numbers of atoms of the ion must equal the charge on the ion. Thus, the sum of oxidation number of three oxygen atoms and one carbon atom in the carbonate ion, (CO3) 2\u2013 must equal \u20132. By the application of above rules, we can find out the oxidation number of the desired element in a molecule or in an ion. It is clear that the metallic elements have positive oxidation number and nonmetallic elements have positive or negative oxidation number. The atoms of transition elements usually display several positive oxidation states. The highest oxidation number of a representative element is the group number for the first two groups and the group number minus 10 (following the long form of periodic table) for the other groups.

Thus aurous chloride and auric chloride are written as Au(I)Cl and Au(III)Cl3. Similarly, stannous chloride and stannic chloride are written as Sn(II)Cl2 and Sn(IV)Cl4. This change in oxidation number implies change in oxidation state, which in turn helps to identify whether the species is present in oxidised form or reduced form.

The idea of oxidation number has been invariably applied to define oxidation, reduction, oxidising agent (oxidant), reducing agent (reductant) and the redox reaction. To summarise, we may say that: *Oxidation:* An increase in the oxidation number of the element in the given substance. *Reduction :* A decrease in the oxidation number of the element in the given substance. *Oxidising agent:* A reagent which can increase the oxidation number of an element in a given substance.

All combustion reactions, which make use of elemental dioxygen, as well as other reactions involving elements other than dioxygen, are redox reactions. Some important examples of this category are: | 0 | 0 | +4 \u20132 | | |---|---------------|--------|--------| | | C(s) + O2 (g) | CO2(g) | (7.24) | | | | | | 0 0 +2 \u20133 3Mg(s) + N2(g) Mg3N2(s) (7.25) $$\\begin{array}{cccc} \\text{ $ -4 + 1$ } & \\text{ $ 0 \\; | +4 - 2$ } & \\text{ $ +1 \\; | -2$ } \\\\ \\text{CH}\\_4\\text{(g) + 2O}\\_2\\text{(g) \\xrightarrow{\\Delta} & \\text{CO}\\_2\\text{(g) } + & \\text{2H}\\_2\\text{O (l)} \\end{array}$$ # *2. Decomposition reactions* Decomposition reactions are the opposite of combination reactions. Precisely, a decomposition reaction leads to the breakdown of a compound into two or more components at least one of which must be in the elemental state. Examples of this class of reactions are: $$\\stackrel{+1}{2}\\text{H}\\_{2}\\text{O} \\text{ (l)} \\xrightarrow{\\text{A}} 2\\text{H}\\_{2}\\text{ (g)} + \\text{O}\\_{2}\\text{(g)} \\quad \\text{ (7.26)}$$ $$2\\text{NaH (s)} \\xrightarrow{\\text{A}} 2\\text{Na (s)} + \\text{H}\\_2\\text{(g)}\\tag{7.27}$$ +1 +5 \u20132 +1 \u20131 0 2KClO3 (s) 2KCl (s) + 3O2(g) (7.28) It may carefully be noted that there is no change in the oxidation number of hydrogen in methane under combination reactions and that of potassium in potassium chlorate in reaction (7.28). This may also be noted here that all decomposition reactions are not redox reactions. For example, decomposition of calcium carbonate is not a redox reaction. $$\\begin{array}{cccc} \\text{+2} \\, \\text{+4} \\, \\text{-2} & \\text{+2} \\, \\text{-2} & \\text{+4} \\, \\text{-2} \\\\ \\text{CaCO}\\_3 \\text{ (s)} \\xrightarrow{\\text{A}} & \\text{CaO} \\text{(s)} & \\text{+} & \\text{CO}\\_2 \\text{(g)} \\end{array}$$ $$\\textbf{3. Displacement reactions}$$ In a displacement reaction, an ion (or an atom) in a compound is replaced by an ion (or an atom) of another element. It may be denoted as: $$\\text{X } + \\text{YZ } \\rightarrow \\text{XZ } + \\text{Y}$$ Displacement reactions fit into two categories: metal displacement and non-metal displacement. *(a) Metal displacement:* A metal in a compound can be displaced by another metal in the uncombined state. We have already discussed about this class of the reactions under section 7.2.1. Metal displacement reactions find many applications in metallurgical processes in which pure metals are obtained from their compounds in ores. A few such examples are: $$\\begin{array}{cccc} \\text{+2+6-2} & \\text{0} & \\text{0} & \\text{+2+6-2} \\\\ \\text{CuSO}\\_4\\text{[aq]} + \\text{Zn (s)} \\rightarrow \\text{Cu(s)} + \\text{ZnSO}\\_4 \\text{ [aq]} \\\\\\\\ \\text{+5-2} & \\text{0} & \\text{0} & \\text{+2-2} \\\\ \\text{NOO}\\_4\\text{[s]} + \\text{5Ca} \\text{ [s]} \\xrightarrow{\\text{A}} & \\text{2V [s]} + \\text{5CaO} \\text{ [s]} \\end{array}$$ $$\\begin{aligned} \\text{V}\\_2\\text{O}\\_5 \\text{ (s)} + 5\\text{Ca (s)} & \\xrightarrow{\\Delta} & 2\\text{V (s)} + 5\\text{CaO (s)}\\\\ \\text{(7.30)}\\\\ \\text{... 4. } & \\text{... } & \\text{... } \\end{aligned} \\tag{7.30}$$ $$\\stackrel{\\star4-1}{\\text{TiCl}\\_4} \\text{ (l)} + 2\\text{Mg (s)} \\stackrel{\\star2-1}{\\longrightarrow} \\text{Ti (s)} + 2\\text{ MgCl}\\_2 \\text{ (s)}\\tag{7.31}$$ $$\\begin{array}{cccc} \\text{+3-2} & 0 & \\text{+3-2} & 0\\\\ \\text{Cr}\\_2\\text{O}\\_3 \\text{ (s)} + 2 \\text{ Al (s)} \\xrightarrow{\\Delta} & \\text{Al}\\_2\\text{O}\\_3 \\text{ (s)} + 2 \\text{Cr(s)} & \\\\ & & & \\text{(7.32)} \\end{array}$$ In each case, the reducing metal is a better reducing agent than the one that is being reduced which evidently shows more capability to lose electrons as compared to the one that is reduced. *(b) Non-metal displacement:* The nonmetal displacement redox reactions include hydrogen displacement and a rarely occurring reaction involving oxygen displacement. Unit 7.indd 242 10\/10\/2022 10:37:04 AM All alkali metals and some alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr, and Ba) which are very good reductants, will displace hydrogen from cold water. 0 +1 \u20132 +1 \u20132 +1 0 2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) \u2192 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) (7.33) 0 +1 \u20132 +2 \u20132 +1 0 Ca(s) + 2H2O(l) \u2192 Ca(OH)2 (aq) + H2(g) (7.34) Less active metals such as magnesium and iron react with steam to produce dihydrogen gas: $$\\begin{array}{cccc} 0 & +1 \\ -2 & +2 \\ -2 \\ +1 & 0\\\\ \\text{Mg(s)} & + & 2H\\_2O(l) \\stackrel{\\Delta}{\\longrightarrow} & \\text{Mg(OH)}\\_2\\text{(s)} + H\\_2\\text{(g)} & \\\\ & & & \\text{(7.35)} \\end{array}$$ 0 +1 \u20132 +3 \u20132 0 2Fe(s) + 3H2O(l) Fe2O3(s) + 3H2(g) (7.36) Many metals, including those which do not react with cold water, are capable of displacing hydrogen from acids. Dihydrogen from acids may even be produced by such metals which do not react with steam. Cadmium and tin are the examples of such metals. A few examples for the displacement of hydrogen from acids are: $$\\begin{array}{cccc} 0 & +1 \\ -1 & +2 \\ -1 & 0\\\\ \\text{Zn(s)} + 2\\text{HCl(aq)} & \\rightarrow \\text{ZnCl}\\_2\\text{(aq)} + \\text{H}\\_2\\text{(g)} &\\\\ & & \\text{(7.37)}\\\\ \\text{Mg(s)} + 2\\text{HCl(aq)} & \\rightarrow \\text{MgCl}\\_2\\text{(aq)} + \\text{H}\\_2\\text{(g)} &\\\\ & & \\text{(7.38)}\\\\ \\text{Fe(s)} & +2\\text{HCl(aq)} & \\rightarrow \\text{FeCl}\\_2\\text{(aq)} + \\text{H}\\_2\\text{(g)} &\\\\ & & \\text{(7.39)} \\end{array}$$ Reactions (7.37 to 7.39) are used to prepare dihydrogen gas in the laboratory. Here, the reactivity of metals is reflected in the rate of hydrogen gas evolution, which is the slowest for the least active metal Fe, and the fastest for the most reactive metal, Mg. Very less active metals, which may occur in the native state such as silver (Ag), and gold (Au) do not react even with hydrochloric acid. In section (7.2.1) we have already discussed that the metals \u2013 zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) through tendency to lose electrons show their reducing activity in the order Zn> Cu>Ag. Like metals, activity series also exists for the halogens. The power of these elements as oxidising agents decreases as we move down from fluorine to iodine in group 17 of the periodic table. This implies that fluorine is so reactive that it can replace chloride, bromide and iodide ions in solution. In fact, fluorine is so reactive that it attacks water and displaces the oxygen of water : $$\\begin{array}{cccc} \\text{+1}-\\text{2} & \\text{0} & \\text{+1}-\\text{1} & \\text{0} \\\\ \\text{2H}\\_{2}\\text{O} \\text{ (l)}+2\\text{F}\\_{2} \\text{ (g)} & \\rightarrow \\text{4HF(aq)} & +\\text{O}\\_{2}\\text{(g)} & \\text{(7.40)}"

            "\\end{array}$$ It is for this reason that the displacement reactions of chlorine, bromine and iodine using fluorine are not generally carried out in aqueous solution. On the other hand, chlorine can displace bromide and iodide ions in an aqueous solution as shown below: $$\\begin{array}{llll} 0 & +1 \\ -1 & +1 \\ -1 & 0\\\\ \\text{Cl}\\_2\\text{(g)} + 2\\text{KBr}\\text{ (aq)} \\rightarrow 2\\text{ KCl (aq)} + \\text{Br}\\_2\\text{(l)}\\\\ & & \\text{(7.41)}\\\\ \\text{Cl}\\_2\\text{(g)} + 2\\text{KI (aq)} \\rightarrow 2\\text{ KCl (aq)} + \\text{I}\\_2\\text{ (s)}\\\\ \\text{Cl}\\_2\\text{(g)} \\rightarrow \\text{Cl}\\_2\\end{array} \\tag{7.42}$$ As Br2 and I2 are coloured and dissolve in CCl4, can easily be identified from the colour of the solution.

Whereas chemical means are available to oxidise Cl\u2013 , Br\u2013 and I\u2013 , as fluorine is the strongest oxidising Unit 7.indd 243 10\/10\/2022 10:37:04 AM agent; there is no way to convert F\u2013 ions to F2 by chemical means. The only way to achieve F2 from F\u2013 is to oxidise electrolytically, the details of which you will study at a later stage. #### *4. Disproportionation reactions* Disproportionation reactions are a special type of redox reactions. In a disproportionation reaction an element in one oxidation state is simultaneously oxidised and reduced. One of the reacting substances in a disproportionation reaction always contains an element that can exist in at least three oxidation states. The element in the form of reacting substance is in the intermediate oxidation state; and both higher and lower oxidation states of that element are formed in the reaction. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is a familiar example of the reaction, where oxygen experiences disproportionation. +1 \u20131 +1 \u20132 0 2H2O2 (aq) \u2192 2H2O(l) + O2(g) (7.45) Here the oxygen of peroxide, which is present in \u20131 state, is converted to zero oxidation state in O2 and decreases to \u20132 oxidation state in H2O. Phosphorous, sulphur and chlorine undergo disproportionation in the alkaline medium as shown below : $$\\begin{array}{ccccc} \\text{0} & \\text{\\$^0\\$B\\$} & \\text{\\$^{-3}\\$OH\\$^{-}\\$(g)\\$^{-1}\\$C^{-1}\\$(aq)\\$^{-1}\\$C^{-1}\\$(aq)\\$^{-1}\\$}\\\\ \\text{P}\\_{4}\\text{(s)} + 3\\text{OH}^{-}\\text{(aq)} + 3\\text{H}\\_{2}\\text{O(l)} & \\text{(aq)}\\\\ & \\text{(aq)} & \\text{(7.46)}\\\\ \\text{S}\\_{8}\\text{(s)} + 12\\text{ OH}^{-}\\text{(aq)} \\to & 4\\text{S}^{2-}\\text{(aq)} + 2\\text{S}\\_{2}\\text{O}\\_{3}^{2-\\text{(aq)}}\\\\ & & \\text{+ 6H}\\_{2}\\text{O(l)}\\\\ \\text{(7.47)}\\\\ \\text{^0} & \\text{^{-1}} & \\text{^{-1}}\\\\ \\text{Cl}\\_{2}\\text{ (g)} + 2\\text{ OH}^{-}\\text{(aq)} \\to & \\text{ClO}^{-}\\text{(aq)} + \\text{Cl}^{-}\\text{(aq)} + \\\\ & & \\text{H}\\_{2}\\text{O(l)}\\\\ \\text{(7.48)}\\\\ \\text{The reaction of (7.48), describes the} \\end{array}$$ The reaction (7.48) describes the formation of household bleaching agents. The hypochlorite ion (ClO\u2013 ) formed in the reaction oxidises the colour-bearing stains of the substances to colourless compounds. It is of interest to mention here that whereas bromine and iodine follow the same trend as exhibited by chlorine in reaction (7.48), 244 chemistry fluorine shows deviation from this behaviour when it reacts with alkali. The reaction that takes place in the case of fluorine is as follows: 2 F2(g) + 2OH\u2013 (aq) \u2192 2 F\u2013 (aq) + OF2(g) + H2O(l) (7.49) (It is to be noted with care that fluorine in reaction (7.49) will undoubtedly attack water to produce some oxygen also). This departure shown by fluorine is not surprising for us as we know the limitation of fluorine that, being the most electronegative element, it cannot exhibit any positive oxidation state. This means that among halogens, fluorine does not show a disproportionation tendency. ### Problem 7.5 Which of the following species, do not show disproportionation reaction and why ?

The reaction (b) involves the breaking down of lead nitrate into three components; therefore, this is categorised under decomposition redox reaction. In reaction (c), hydrogen of water has been displaced by hydride ion into dihydrogen gas. Therefore, this may be called as displacement redox reaction. The reaction (d) involves disproportionation of NO2 (+4 state) into NO2 \u2013 (+3 state) and NO3 \u2013 (+5 state).

On the other hand, chlorine can displace bromide and iodide ions in an aqueous solution as shown below: $$\\begin{array}{llll} 0 & +1 \\ -1 & +1 \\ -1 & 0\\\\ \\text{Cl}\\_2\\text{(g)} + 2\\text{KBr}\\text{ (aq)} \\rightarrow 2\\text{ KCl (aq)} + \\text{Br}\\_2\\text{(l)}\\\\ & & \\text{(7.41)}\\\\ \\text{Cl}\\_2\\text{(g)} + 2\\text{KI (aq)} \\rightarrow 2\\text{ KCl (aq)} + \\text{I}\\_2\\text{ (s)}\\\\ \\text{Cl}\\_2\\text{(g)} \\rightarrow \\text{Cl}\\_2\\end{array} \\tag{7.42}$$ As Br2 and I2 are coloured and dissolve in CCl4, can easily be identified from the colour of the solution. The above reactions can be written in ionic form as: $$\\begin{array}{cccc} \\text{O} & \\text{O}^{-1} & \\text{-I} & \\text{0} \\\\ \\text{Cl}\\_{2} \\text{ (g)} + 2 \\text{Br}^{-} \\text{ (aq)} \\rightarrow 2 \\text{Cl}^{-} \\text{ (aq)} + \\text{Br}\\_{2} \\text{ (l)} & \\text{(7.41a)} \\\\ \\text{O} & \\text{-I} & \\text{-I} & \\text{0} \\\\ \\text{Cl}\\_{2} \\text{ (g)} + 2 \\text{I}^{-} \\text{ (aq)} \\rightarrow 2 \\text{Cl}^{-} \\text{ (aq)} + \\text{I}\\_{2} \\text{ (s)} & \\text{(7.42b)} \\end{array}$$ Reactions (7.41) and (7.42) form the basis of identifying Br\u2013 and I\u2013 in the laboratory through the test popularly known as 'Layer Test'. It may not be out of place to mention here that bromine likewise can displace iodide ion in solution: $$\\begin{array}{cccc} 0 & -1 & -1 & 0\\\\ \\text{Br}\\_2\\text{ (l)} & +2\\text{I}^-\\text{ (aq)} \\rightarrow 2\\text{Br}^-\\text{ (aq)} + \\text{I}\\_2\\text{ (s)} & \\text{ (7.43)}\\\\ \\end{array}$$ The halogen displacement reactions have a direct industrial application. The recovery of halogens from their halides requires an oxidation process, which is represented by: $$\\rm 2X^{-} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad X\\_{2} + \\, 2e^{-} \\tag{7.44}$$ here X denotes a halogen element. Whereas chemical means are available to oxidise Cl\u2013 , Br\u2013 and I\u2013 , as fluorine is the strongest oxidising Unit 7.indd 243 10\/10\/2022 10:37:04 AM agent; there is no way to convert F\u2013 ions to F2 by chemical means. The only way to achieve F2 from F\u2013 is to oxidise electrolytically, the details of which you will study at a later stage. #### *4. Disproportionation reactions* Disproportionation reactions are a special type of redox reactions. In a disproportionation reaction an element in one oxidation state is simultaneously oxidised and reduced. One of the reacting substances in a disproportionation reaction always contains an element that can exist in at least three oxidation states. The element in the form of reacting substance is in the intermediate oxidation state; and both higher and lower oxidation states of that element are formed in the reaction. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is a familiar example of the reaction, where oxygen experiences disproportionation. +1 \u20131 +1 \u20132 0 2H2O2 (aq) \u2192 2H2O(l) + O2(g) (7.45) Here the oxygen of peroxide, which is present in \u20131 state, is converted to zero oxidation state in O2 and decreases to \u20132 oxidation state in H2O. Phosphorous, sulphur and chlorine undergo disproportionation in the alkaline medium as shown below : $$\\begin{array}{ccccc} \\text{0} & \\text{\\$^0\\$B\\$} & \\text{\\$^{-3}\\$OH\\$^{-}\\$(g)\\$^{-1}\\$C^{-1}\\$(aq)\\$^{-1}\\$C^{-1}\\$(aq)\\$^{-1}\\$}\\\\ \\text{P}\\_{4}\\text{(s)} + 3\\text{OH}^{-}\\text{(aq)} + 3\\text{H}\\_{2}\\text{O(l)} & \\text{(aq)}\\\\ & \\text{(aq)} & \\text{(7.46)}\\\\ \\text{S}\\_{8}\\text{(s)} + 12\\text{ OH}^{-}\\text{(aq)} \\to & 4\\text{S}^{2-}\\text{(aq)} + 2\\text{S}\\_{2}\\text{O}\\_{3}^{2-\\text{(aq)}}\\\\ & & \\text{+ 6H}\\_{2}\\text{O(l)}\\\\ \\text{(7.47)}\\\\ \\text{^0} & \\text{^{-1}} & \\text{^{-1}}\\\\ \\text{Cl}\\_{2}\\text{ (g)} + 2\\text{ OH}^{-}\\text{(aq)} \\to & \\text{ClO}^{-}\\text{(aq)} + \\text{Cl}^{-}\\text{(aq)} + \\\\ & & \\text{H}\\_{2}\\text{O(l)}\\\\ \\text{(7.48)}\\\\ \\text{The reaction of (7.48), describes the} \\end{array}$$ The reaction (7.48) describes the formation of household bleaching agents. The hypochlorite ion (ClO\u2013 ) formed in the reaction oxidises the colour-bearing stains of the substances to colourless compounds. It is of interest to mention here that whereas bromine and iodine follow the same trend as exhibited by chlorine in reaction (7.48), 244 chemistry fluorine shows deviation from this behaviour when it reacts with alkali. The reaction that takes place in the case of fluorine is as follows: 2 F2(g) + 2OH\u2013 (aq) \u2192 2 F\u2013 (aq) + OF2(g) + H2O(l) (7.49) (It is to be noted with care that fluorine in reaction (7.49) will undoubtedly attack water to produce some oxygen also). This departure shown by fluorine is not surprising for us as we know the limitation of fluorine that, being the most electronegative element, it cannot exhibit any positive oxidation state. This means that among halogens, fluorine does not show a disproportionation tendency. ### Problem 7.5 Which of the following species, do not show disproportionation reaction and why ? ClO\u2013 , ClO2 \u2013 , ClO<sup>3<\/sup> \u2013 and ClO4 \u2013 Also write reaction for each of the species that disproportionates. #### Solution Among the oxoanions of chlorine listed above, ClO4 \u2013 does not disproportionate because in this oxoanion chlorine is present in its highest oxidation state that is, +7. The disproportionation reactions for the other three oxoanions of chlorine are as follows: $$\\begin{array}{rcl} \\mathrm{^{+1}} & \\mathrm{^{-1}} & \\mathrm{^{+5}}\\\\ \\mathrm{3ClO^{-}} & \\to & 2\\mathrm{Cl^{-}} + \\mathrm{ClO\\_{3}^{-}}\\\\ \\mathrm{^{+3}} & \\mathrm{^{+5}} & \\mathrm{^{-1}}\\\\ \\mathrm{6ClO\\_{2}^{-}} & \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{hv}} & \\mathrm{4ClO\\_{3}^{-}} + 2\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}\\\\ \\mathrm{^{+5}} & \\mathrm{^{-1}} & \\mathrm{^{+7}}\\\\ \\mathrm{4ClO\\_{3}^{-}} & \\to & \\mathrm{Cl^{-}} + \\mathrm{^{3}} \\mathrm{ClO\\_{4}^{-}} \\end{array}$$ #### Problem 7.6 Suggest a scheme of classification of the following redox reactions $$\\begin{aligned} \\text{(a)}\\ \\mathrm{N}\\_{2}\\ \\text{(g)} + \\mathrm{O}\\_{2}\\ \\text{(g)} &\\rightarrow 2\\ \\mathrm{NO}\\ \\text{(g)}\\\\ \\text{(b)}\\ 2\\mathrm{Pb(NO}\\_{3}\\ \\text{(s)} &\\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{PbO(s)} + 4\\ \\mathrm{NO}\\_{2}\\ \\text{(g)} + \\mathrm{O}\\_{2} \\\\ &\\text{O}\\_{2}\\ \\text{(g)}\\\\ \\text{(c)}\\ \\mathrm{NaH(s)} + \\mathrm{H}\\_{2}\\mathrm{O(l)} &\\rightarrow \\mathrm{NaOH(aq)} + \\mathrm{H}\\_{2}\\ \\text{(g)}\\\\ \\text{(d)}\\ 2\\mathrm{NO}\\_{2}\\ \\text{(g)} + 2\\mathrm{OH}\\ \\text{(aq)} &\\rightarrow \\mathrm{NO}\\_{2}\\ \\text{(aq)} + \\\\ &\\text{NO}\\_{3}^{-}\\ \\text{(aq)} + \\mathrm{H}\\_{2}\\mathrm{O(l)} \\end{aligned}$$ Unit 7.indd 244 11\/10\/2022 15:18:43 #### Solution In reaction (a), the compound nitric oxide is formed by the combination of the elemental substances, nitrogen and oxygen; therefore, this is an example of combination redox reactions. The reaction (b) involves the breaking down of lead nitrate into three components; therefore, this is categorised under decomposition redox reaction. In reaction (c), hydrogen of water has been displaced by hydride ion into dihydrogen gas. Therefore, this may be called as displacement redox reaction. The reaction (d) involves disproportionation of NO2 (+4 state) into NO2 \u2013 (+3 state) and NO3 \u2013 (+5 state). Therefore reaction (d) is an example of disproportionation redox reaction. #### The Paradox of Fractional Oxidation Number Sometimes, we come across with"

In PbO2, lead is present in +4 oxidation state, whereas the stable oxidation state of lead in PbO is +2. PbO2 thus can act as an oxidant (oxidising agent) and, therefore, can oxidise Cl\u2013 ion of HCl into chlorine. We may also keep in mind that PbO is a basic oxide. Therefore, the reaction Pb3O4 + 8HCl \u2192 3PbCl2 + Cl2 + 4H2O can be splitted into two reactions namely: 2PbO + 4HCl \u2192 2PbCl2 + 2H2O (acid-base reaction) +4 \u20131 +2 0 PbO2 + 4HCl \u2192 PbCl2 + Cl2 +2H2O (redox reaction) Since HNO3 itself is an oxidising agent therefore, it is unlikely that the reaction may occur between PbO2 and HNO3. However, the acid-base reaction occurs between PbO and HNO3 as: 2PbO + 4HNO3 \u2192 2Pb(NO3) 2 + 2H2O It is the passive nature of PbO2 against HNO3 that makes the reaction different from the one that follows with HCl. # 7.3.2 Balancing of Redox Reactions Two methods are used to balance chemical equations for redox processes.

Both these methods are in use and the choice of their use rests with the individual using them. *(a) Oxidation Number Method:* In writing equations for oxidation-reduction reactions, just as for other reactions, the compositions and formulas must be known for the substances that react and for the products that are formed. The oxidation number method is now best illustrated in the following steps: Step 1: Write the correct formula for each reactant and product. Step 2: Identify atoms which undergo change in oxidation number in the reaction by assigning the oxidation number to all elements in the reaction. Step 3: Calculate the increase or decrease in the oxidation number per atom and for the entire molecule\/ion in which it occurs. If these are not equal then multiply by suitable number so that these become equal. (If you realise that two substances are reduced and nothing is oxidised or vice-versa, something is wrong.

Step 4: Ascertain the involvement of ions if the reaction is taking place in water, add H+ or OH\u2013 ions to the expression on the appropriate side so that the total ionic charges of reactants and products are equal. If the reaction is carried out in acidic solution, use H+ ions in the equation; if in basic solution, use OH\u2013 ions. Step 5 : Make the numbers of hydrogen atoms in the expression on the two sides equal by adding water (H2O) molecules to the reactants or products. Now, also check the number of oxygen atoms.

Unit 7.indd 246 10\/10\/2022 10:37:04 AM # Solution Step 1: The skeletal ionic equation is: Cr2O7 2\u2013(aq) + SO3 2\u2013(aq) \u2192 Cr3+(aq) + SO4 2\u2013(aq) Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers for Cr and S +6 \u20132 +4 \u20132 +3 +6 \u20132 Cr2O7 2\u2013(aq) + SO3 2\u2013(aq) \u2192 Cr(aq)+SO4 2\u2013(aq) This indicates that the dichromate ion is the oxidant and the sulphite ion is the reductant. Step 3: Calculate the increase and decrease of oxidation number, and make them equal: from step-2 we can notice that there is change in oxidation state of chromium and sulphur. Oxidation state of chromium changes form +6 to +3. There is decrease of +3 in oxidation state of chromium on right hand side of the equation. Oxidation state of sulphur changes from +4 to +6. There is an increase of +2 in the oxidation state of sulphur on right hand side. To make the increase and decrease of oxidation state equal, place numeral 2 before cromium ion on right hand side and numeral 3 before sulphate ion on right hand side and balance the chromium and sulphur atoms on both the sides of the equation. Thus we get $$\\begin{array}{rcl} \\text{+6}-2 & \\text{+4}-2 & \\text{+3} \\\\ \\text{Cr}\\_2\\text{O}\\_7\\text{-(aq)} + 3\\text{SO}\\_3^{2-} \\text{ (aq)} & \\xrightarrow{} 2\\text{Cr}^{3+} \\text{ (aq)}+ \\\\ & & \\text{+6}-2 \\\\ & & \\text{3SO}\\_4^{2-} \\text{ (aq)} \\end{array}$$ Step 4: As the reaction occurs in the acidic medium, and further the ionic charges are not equal on both the sides, add 8H+ on the left to make ionic charges equal Cr2O7 2\u2013(aq) + 3SO3 2\u2013(aq)+ 8H+\u2192 2Cr3+(aq) + 3SO4 2\u2013 (aq) Step 5: Finally, count the hydrogen atoms, and add appropriate number of water molecules (i.e., 4H2O) on the right to achieve balanced redox change. Cr2O7 2\u2013 (aq) + 3SO3 2\u2013 (aq)+ 8H+ (aq) \u2192 2Cr3+ (aq) + 3SO4 2\u2013 (aq) +4H2O (l) #### Problem 7.9 Permanganate ion reacts with bromide ion in basic medium to give manganese dioxide and bromate ion.

Suppose we are to balance the equation showing the oxidation of Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions by dichromate ions (Cr2O7) 2\u2013 in acidic medium, wherein, Cr2O7 2\u2013 ions are reduced to Cr3+ ions. The following steps are involved in this task. Step 1: Produce unbalanced equation for the reaction in ionic form : $$\\rm{Fe^{2+}\\text{(aq)} + Cr\\_2O\\_7^{2-} \\text{(aq)} \\to Fe^{3+} \\text{(aq)} + Cr^{3+} \\text{(aq)}}\\tag{7.50}$$ Unit 7.indd 247 10\/10\/2022 10:37:05 AM Step 2: Separate the equation into halfreactions: +2 +3 Oxidation half : Fe2+ (aq) \u2192 Fe3+(aq) (7.51) +6 \u20132 +3 Reduction half : Cr2O7 2\u2013(aq) \u2192 Cr3+(aq) (7.52) Step 3: Balance the atoms other than O and H in each half reaction individually. Here the oxidation half reaction is already balanced with respect to Fe atoms. For the reduction half reaction, we multiply the Cr3+ by 2 to balance Cr atoms. $$\\text{Cr}\\_2\\text{O}\\_7^{2-}\\text{(aq)} \\rightarrow \\text{ 2 Cr}^{3+}\\text{(aq)}\\tag{7.53}$$ Step 4: For reactions occurring in acidic medium, add H2O to balance O atoms and H+ to balance H atoms. Thus, we get : $$\\rm{Cr}\\_2\\rm{O}\\_7^{2-}\\rm{(aq)} + 14H^+\\rm{(aq)} \\to 2\\rm{Cr^{3+}(aq)} + 7\\rm{H\\_2O} \\text{ (l)}\\tag{7.54}$$ Step 5: Add electrons to one side of the half reaction to balance the charges. If need be, make the number of electrons equal in the two half reactions by multiplying one or both half reactions by appropriate number. The oxidation half reaction is thus rewritten to balance the charge: $$\\text{Fe}^{2+}\\text{ (aq)} \\rightarrow \\text{Fe}^{3+}\\text{ (aq)} + \\text{e}^{\\cdot}\\text{ (}\\cdot\\text{ }\\qquad\\text{ (7.55)}$$ Now in the reduction half reaction there are net twelve positive charges on the left hand side and only six positive charges on the right hand side.

            "us now explain the steps involved in the method with the help of a few problems given below: #### Problem 7.8 Write the net ionic equation for the reaction of potassium dichromate(VI), K2Cr2O7 with sodium sulphite, Na2SO3, in an acid solution to give chromium(III) ion and the sulphate ion. Unit 7.indd 246 10\/10\/2022 10:37:04 AM # Solution Step 1: The skeletal ionic equation is: Cr2O7 2\u2013(aq) + SO3 2\u2013(aq) \u2192 Cr3+(aq) + SO4 2\u2013(aq) Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers for Cr and S +6 \u20132 +4 \u20132 +3 +6 \u20132 Cr2O7 2\u2013(aq) + SO3 2\u2013(aq) \u2192 Cr(aq)+SO4 2\u2013(aq) This indicates that the dichromate ion is the oxidant and the sulphite ion is the reductant. Step 3: Calculate the increase and decrease of oxidation number, and make them equal: from step-2 we can notice that there is change in oxidation state of chromium and sulphur. Oxidation state of chromium changes form +6 to +3. There is decrease of +3 in oxidation state of chromium on right hand side of the equation. Oxidation state of sulphur changes from +4 to +6. There is an increase of +2 in the oxidation state of sulphur on right hand side. To make the increase and decrease of oxidation state equal, place numeral 2 before cromium ion on right hand side and numeral 3 before sulphate ion on right hand side and balance the chromium and sulphur atoms on both the sides of the equation. Thus we get $$\\begin{array}{rcl} \\text{+6}-2 & \\text{+4}-2 & \\text{+3} \\\\ \\text{Cr}\\_2\\text{O}\\_7\\text{-(aq)} + 3\\text{SO}\\_3^{2-} \\text{ (aq)} & \\xrightarrow{} 2\\text{Cr}^{3+} \\text{ (aq)}+ \\\\ & & \\text{+6}-2 \\\\ & & \\text{3SO}\\_4^{2-} \\text{ (aq)} \\end{array}$$ Step 4: As the reaction occurs in the acidic medium, and further the ionic charges are not equal on both the sides, add 8H+ on the left to make ionic charges equal Cr2O7 2\u2013(aq) + 3SO3 2\u2013(aq)+ 8H+\u2192 2Cr3+(aq) + 3SO4 2\u2013 (aq) Step 5: Finally, count the hydrogen atoms, and add appropriate number of water molecules (i.e., 4H2O) on the right to achieve balanced redox change. Cr2O7 2\u2013 (aq) + 3SO3 2\u2013 (aq)+ 8H+ (aq) \u2192 2Cr3+ (aq) + 3SO4 2\u2013 (aq) +4H2O (l) #### Problem 7.9 Permanganate ion reacts with bromide ion in basic medium to give manganese dioxide and bromate ion. Write the balanced ionic equation for the reaction. #### Solution Step 1: The skeletal ionic equation is : MnO4 \u2013 (aq) + Br\u2013 (aq) \u2192 MnO2(s) + BrO3 \u2013 (aq) Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers for Mn and Br +7 \u20131 +4 +5 MnO4 \u2013 (aq) + Br\u2013 (aq) \u2192MnO2 (s) + BrO3 \u2013 (aq) this indicates that permanganate ion is the oxidant and bromide ion is the reductant. Step 3: Calculate the increase and decrease of oxidation number, and make the increase equal to the decrease. +7 \u20131 +4 +5 2MnO4 \u2013 (aq)+Br \u2013 (aq) \u2192 2MnO2(s)+BrO3 \u2013 (aq) Step 4: As the reaction occurs in the basic medium, and the ionic charges are not equal on both sides, add 2 OH\u2013 ions on the right to make ionic charges equal. 2MnO4 \u2013 (aq) + Br\u2013 (aq) \u2192 2MnO2(s) + BrO3 \u2013 (aq) + 2OH\u2013 (aq) Step 5: Finally, count the hydrogen atoms and add appropriate number of water molecules (i.e. one H2O molecule) on the left side to achieve balanced redox change. 2MnO4 \u2013 (aq) + Br\u2013 (aq) + H2O(l) \u2192 2MnO2(s) + BrO3 \u2013 (aq) + 2OH\u2013 (aq) *(b) Half Reaction Method:* In this method, the two half equations are balanced separately and then added together to give balanced equation. Suppose we are to balance the equation showing the oxidation of Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions by dichromate ions (Cr2O7) 2\u2013 in acidic medium, wherein, Cr2O7 2\u2013 ions are reduced to Cr3+ ions. The following steps are involved in this task. Step 1: Produce unbalanced equation for the reaction in ionic form : $$\\rm{Fe^{2+}\\text{(aq)} + Cr\\_2O\\_7^{2-} \\text{(aq)} \\to Fe^{3+} \\text{(aq)} + Cr^{3+} \\text{(aq)}}\\tag{7.50}$$ Unit 7.indd 247 10\/10\/2022 10:37:05 AM Step 2: Separate the equation into halfreactions: +2 +3 Oxidation half : Fe2+ (aq) \u2192 Fe3+(aq) (7.51) +6 \u20132 +3 Reduction half : Cr2O7 2\u2013(aq) \u2192 Cr3+(aq) (7.52) Step 3: Balance the atoms other than O and H in each half reaction individually. Here the oxidation half reaction is already balanced with respect to Fe atoms. For the reduction half reaction, we multiply the Cr3+ by 2 to balance Cr atoms. $$\\text{Cr}\\_2\\text{O}\\_7^{2-}\\text{(aq)} \\rightarrow \\text{ 2 Cr}^{3+}\\text{(aq)}\\tag{7.53}$$ Step 4: For reactions occurring in acidic medium, add H2O to balance O atoms and H+ to balance H atoms. Thus, we get : $$\\rm{Cr}\\_2\\rm{O}\\_7^{2-}\\rm{(aq)} + 14H^+\\rm{(aq)} \\to 2\\rm{Cr^{3+}(aq)} + 7\\rm{H\\_2O} \\text{ (l)}\\tag{7.54}$$ Step 5: Add electrons to one side of the half reaction to balance the charges. If need be, make the number of electrons equal in the two half reactions by multiplying one or both half reactions by appropriate number. The oxidation half reaction is thus rewritten to balance the charge: $$\\text{Fe}^{2+}\\text{ (aq)} \\rightarrow \\text{Fe}^{3+}\\text{ (aq)} + \\text{e}^{\\cdot}\\text{ (}\\cdot\\text{ }\\qquad\\text{ (7.55)}$$ Now in the reduction half reaction there are net twelve positive charges on the left hand side and only six positive charges on the right hand side. Therefore, we add six electrons on the left side. $$\\rm{Cr}\\_2\\rm{O}\\_7^{2-} \\text{(aq)} + 14H^+ \\text{(aq)} + 6e^- \\rightarrow 2Cr^{3+} \\text{(aq)} + \\dots \\quad \\text{(7H}\\_2\\rm{O} \\text{ (l)} \\text{ (7.56)}$$ To equalise the number of electrons in both the half reactions, we multiply the oxidation half reaction by 6 and write as : $$6\\text{Fe}^{2+}\\text{ (aq)} \\rightarrow 6\\text{Fe}^{3+}\\text{(aq)} \\;+\\;6\\text{e}^{-}\\tag{7.57}$$ Step 6: We add the two half reactions to achieve the overall reaction and cancel the electrons on each side. This gives the net ionic equation as : $$\\begin{aligned} \\text{6Fe}^{2+}\\text{(aq)} + \\text{Cr}\\_2\\text{O}\\_7^{2-}\\text{(aq)} + 14\\text{H}^+\\text{(aq)} &\\rightarrow \\text{6 Fe}^{3+}\\text{(aq)} + \\text{C} \\\\ 2\\text{Cr}^{3+}\\text{(aq)} &+ 7\\text{H}\\_2\\text{O(l)} \\end{aligned}$$ Step 7: Verify that the equation contains the same type and number of atoms and the same charges on both sides of the equation.

Similarly, in redox systems, the titration method can be adopted to determine the strength of a reductant\/ oxidant using a redox sensitive indicator. The usage of indicators in redox titration is illustrated below: (i) In one situation, the reagent itself is intensely coloured, e.g., permanganate ion, MnO4 \u2013 . Here MnO4 \u2013 acts as the self indicator. The visible end point in this case is achieved after the last of the reductant (Fe2+ or C2O4 2\u2013) is oxidised and the first lasting tinge of pink colour appears at MnO4 \u2013 concentration as low as 10\u20136 mol dm\u20133 (10\u20136 mol L\u20131). This ensures a minimal 'overshoot' in colour beyond the equivalence point, the point where the reductant and the oxidant are equal in terms of their mole stoichiometry. - (ii) If there is no dramatic auto-colour change (as with MnO4 \u2013 titration), there are indicators which are oxidised immediately after the last bit of the reactant is consumed, producing a dramatic colour change. The best example is afforded by Cr2O7 2\u2013, which is not a self-indicator, but oxidises the indicator substance diphenylamine just after the equivalence point to produce an intense blue colour, thus signalling the end point. - (iii) There is yet another method which is interesting and quite common. Its use is restricted to those reagents which are able to oxidise I\u2013 ions, say, for example, Cu(II): 2Cu2+(aq) + 4I\u2013 (aq) \u2192 Cu2I 2(s) + I2(aq) (7.59) This method relies on the facts that iodine itself gives an intense blue colour with starch and has a very specific reaction with thiosulphate ions (S2O3 2\u2013), which too is a redox reaction: I2(aq) + 2 S2O3 2\u2013(aq)\u21922I\u2013 (aq) + S4O6 2\u2013(aq) (7.60) I2, though insoluble in water, remains in solution containing KI as KI3. On addition of starch after the liberation of iodine from the reaction of Cu2+ ions on iodide ions, an intense blue colour appears. This colour disappears as soon as the iodine is consumed by the thiosulphate ions. Thus, the end-point can easily be tracked and the rest is the stoichiometric calculation only. # 7.3.4 Limitations of Concept of Oxidation Number As you have observed in the above discussion, the concept of redox processes has been evolving with time. This process of evolution is continuing. In fact, in recent past the oxidation process is visualised as a decrease in electron density and reduction process as an increase in electron density around the atom(s) involved in the reaction."

            "# 7.4 Redox Reactions and Electrode Processes The experiment corresponding to reaction (7.15), can also be observed if zinc rod is dipped in copper sulphate solution. The redox reaction takes place and during the Unit 7.indd 249 10\/10\/2022 10:37:05 AM reaction, zinc is oxidised to zinc ions and copper ions are reduced to metallic copper due to direct transfer of electrons from zinc to copper ion. During this reaction heat is also evolved. Now we modify the experiment in such a manner that for the same redox reaction transfer of electrons takes place indirectly. This necessitates the separation of zinc metal from copper sulphate solution. We take copper sulphate solution in a beaker and put a copper strip or rod in it. We also take zinc sulphate solution in another beaker and put a zinc rod or strip in it. Now reaction takes place in either of the beakers and at the interface of the metal and its salt solution in each beaker both the reduced and oxidized forms of the same species are present. These represent the species in the reduction and oxidation half reactions. A redox couple is defined as having together the oxidised and reduced forms of a substance taking part in an oxidation or reduction half reaction. This is represented by separating the oxidised form from the reduced form by a vertical line or a slash representing an interface (e.g. solid\/solution). For example in this experiment the two redox couples ![](_page_15_Figure_3.jpeg) ![](_page_15_Figure_4.jpeg) 250 chemistry are represented as Zn2+\/Zn and Cu2+\/Cu. In both cases, oxidised form is put before the reduced form. Now we put the beaker containing copper sulphate solution and the beaker containing zinc sulphate solution side by side (Fig. 7.3). We connect solutions in two beakers by a salt bridge (a U-tube containing a solution of potassium chloride or ammonium nitrate usually solidified by boiling with agar agar and later cooling to a jelly like substance). This provides an electric contact between the two solutions without allowing them to mix with each other. The zinc and copper rods are connected by a metallic wire with a provision for an ammeter and a switch. The set-up as shown in Fig.7.3 is known as Daniell cell. When the switch is in the off position, no reaction takes place in either of the beakers and no current flows through the metallic wire. As soon as the switch is in the on position, we make the following observations: - 1. The transfer of electrons now does not take place directly from Zn to Cu2+ but through the metallic wire connecting the two rods as is apparent from the arrow which indicates the flow of current. - 2. The electricity from solution in one beaker to solution in the other beaker flows by the migration of ions through the salt bridge. We know that the flow of current is possible only if there is a potential difference between the copper and zinc rods known as electrodes here. The potential associated with each electrode is known as electrode potential. If the concentration of each species taking part in the electrode reaction is unity (if any gas appears in the electrode reaction, it is confined to 1 atmospheric pressure) and further the reaction is carried out at 298K, then the potential of each electrode is said to be the Standard Electrode Potential. By convention, the standard electrode potential (E) of hydrogen electrode is 0.00 volts. The electrode potential value for each electrode process is a measure of the relative tendency of the active species in the process to remain in the oxidised\/reduced form. A negative E means that the redox couple is a stronger Unit 7.indd 250 10\/10\/2022 10:37:05 AM reducing agent than the H+\/H2 couple. A positive E means that the redox couple is a weaker reducing agent than the H+\/H2 couple.

        "question":"What is the role of zinc in redox reactions as per the JEE context?",
        "answer":"In the context of redox reactions, zinc is oxidized to zinc ions, and copper ions are reduced to metallic copper due to the direct transfer of electrons from zinc to copper ions when a zinc rod is dipped in copper sulphate solution. This process also evolves heat. In a modified experiment, zinc metal is separated from copper sulphate solution, and the redox couple is represented as Zn2+\/Zn.",
        "contexts":[
            "# 7.4 Redox Reactions and Electrode Processes The experiment corresponding to reaction (7.15), can also be observed if zinc rod is dipped in copper sulphate solution. The redox reaction takes place and during the Unit 7.indd 249 10\/10\/2022 10:37:05 AM reaction, zinc is oxidised to zinc ions and copper ions are reduced to metallic copper due to direct transfer of electrons from zinc to copper ion. During this reaction heat is also evolved. Now we modify the experiment in such a manner that for the same redox reaction transfer of electrons takes place indirectly. This necessitates the separation of zinc metal from copper sulphate solution. We take copper sulphate solution in a beaker and put a copper strip or rod in it. We also take zinc sulphate solution in another beaker and put a zinc rod or strip in it. Now reaction takes place in either of the beakers and at the interface of the metal and its salt solution in each beaker both the reduced and oxidized forms of the same species are present. These represent the species in the reduction and oxidation half reactions. A redox couple is defined as having together the oxidised and reduced forms of a substance taking part in an oxidation or reduction half reaction. This is represented by separating the oxidised form from the reduced form by a vertical line or a slash representing an interface (e.g. solid\/solution). For example in this experiment the two redox couples ![](_page_15_Figure_3.jpeg) ![](_page_15_Figure_4.jpeg) 250 chemistry are represented as Zn2+\/Zn and Cu2+\/Cu. In both cases, oxidised form is put before the reduced form. Now we put the beaker containing copper sulphate solution and the beaker containing zinc sulphate solution side by side (Fig. 7.3). We connect solutions in two beakers by a salt bridge (a U-tube containing a solution of potassium chloride or ammonium nitrate usually solidified by boiling with agar agar and later cooling to a jelly like substance). This provides an electric contact between the two solutions without allowing them to mix with each other. The zinc and copper rods are connected by a metallic wire with a provision for an ammeter and a switch. The set-up as shown in Fig.7.3 is known as Daniell cell. When the switch is in the off position, no reaction takes place in either of the beakers and no current flows through the metallic wire. As soon as the switch is in the on position, we make the following observations: - 1. The transfer of electrons now does not take place directly from Zn to Cu2+ but through the metallic wire connecting the two rods as is apparent from the arrow which indicates the flow of current. - 2. The electricity from solution in one beaker to solution in the other beaker flows by the migration of ions through the salt bridge. We know that the flow of current is possible only if there is a potential difference between the copper and zinc rods known as electrodes here. The potential associated with each electrode is known as electrode potential. If the concentration of each species taking part in the electrode reaction is unity (if any gas appears in the electrode reaction, it is confined to 1 atmospheric pressure) and further the reaction is carried out at 298K, then the potential of each electrode is said to be the Standard Electrode Potential. By convention, the standard electrode potential (E) of hydrogen electrode is 0.00 volts. The electrode potential value for each electrode process is a measure of the relative tendency of the active species in the process to remain in the oxidised\/reduced form. A negative E means that the redox couple is a stronger Unit 7.indd 250 10\/10\/2022 10:37:05 AM reducing agent than the H+\/H2 couple. A positive E means that the redox couple is a weaker reducing agent than the H+\/H2 couple. The standard electrode potentials are very important and we can get a lot of other useful information from them.

            "8.2 TETRAVALENCE OF CARBON: SHAPES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS #### 8.2.1 The Shapes of Carbon Compounds The knowledge of fundamental concepts of molecular structure helps in understanding and predicting the properties of organic compounds. You have already learnt theories of valency and molecular structure in Unit 4. Also, you already know that tetravalence of carbon and the formation of covalent bonds by it are explained in terms of its electronic configuration and the hybridisation of *s* and *p* orbitals. It may be recalled that formation and the shapes of molecules like methane (CH4), ethene (C2H4), ethyne (C2H2) are explained in terms of the use of *sp3*, *sp2* and *sp* hybrid orbitals by carbon atoms in the respective molecules. Hybridisation influences the bond length and bond enthalpy (strength) in compounds. The *sp* hybrid orbital contains more *s* character and hence it is closer to its nucleus and forms shorter and stronger bonds than the *sp*3 hybrid orbital. The *sp*2 hybrid orbital is intermediate in *s* character between *sp* and *sp*3 and, hence, the length and enthalpy of the bonds it forms, are also intermediate between them. The change in hybridisation affects the electronegativity of carbon. The greater the *s* character of the hybrid orbitals, the greater is the electronegativity. Thus, a carbon atom having an *sp* hybrid orbital with 50% *s* character is more electronegative than that possessing *sp*2 or *sp*3 hybridised orbitals. This relative electronegativity is reflected in several physical and chemical properties of the molecules concerned, about which you will learn in later units. # 8.2.2 Some Characteristic Features of \u03c0 Bonds In a \u03c0 (pi) bond formation, parallel orientation of the two *p* orbitals on adjacent atoms is necessary for a proper sideways overlap. Thus, in H2C=CH2 molecule all the atoms must be in the same plane. The *p* orbitals are mutually parallel and both the *p* orbitals are perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. Rotation of one CH2 fragment with respect to other interferes with maximum overlap of *p* orbitals and, therefore, such rotation about carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is restricted. The electron charge cloud of the \u03c0 bond is located above and below the plane of bonding atoms. This results in the electrons being easily available to the attacking reagents.

            "8.3 STRUCTURAL RepresenTATI ONS OF organic COMPOUNDs # 8.3.1 Complete, Condensed and Bond-line Structural Formulas Structures of organic compounds are represented in several ways. The *Lewis structure* or dot structure, dash structure, condensed structure and bond line structural formulas are some of the specific types. The Lewis structures, however, can be simplified by representing the two-electron covalent bond by a dash (\u2013). Such a structural formula focuses on the electrons involved in bond formation. A single dash represents a single bond, double dash is used for double bond and a triple dash represents triple bond. Lonepairs of electrons on heteroatoms (*e.g*., oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, halogens etc.) may or may not be shown. Thus, ethane (C2H6), ethene (C2H4), ethyne (C2H2) and methanol (CH3OH) can be represented by the following structural formulas. Such structural representations are called *complete structural formulas*. ![](_page_2_Figure_4.jpeg) These structural formulas can be further abbreviated by omitting some or all of the dashes representing covalent bonds and by indicating the number of identical groups attached to an atom by a subscript. The resulting expression of the compound is called a *condensed structural formula*. Thus, ethane, ethene, ethyne and methanol can be written as: | CH3CH3 | H2C=CH2 | HC\u2261CH | CH3OH | |--------|---------|--------|----------| | Ethane | Ethene | Ethyne | Methanol | #### 258 chemistry Similarly, CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 can be further condensed to CH3(CH2) 6CH3. For further simplification, organic chemists use another way of representing the structures, in which only lines are used. In this *bond-line structural* representation of organic compounds, carbon and hydrogen atoms are not shown and the lines representing carbon-carbon bonds are drawn in a *zig-zag* fashion. The only atoms specifically written are oxygen, chlorine, nitrogen etc. The terminals denote methyl (\u2013CH3) groups (unless indicated otherwise by a functional group), while the line junctions denote carbon atoms bonded to appropriate number of hydrogens required to satisfy the valency of the carbon atoms. Some of the examples are represented as follows: (i) 3-Methyloctane can be represented in various forms as: ![](_page_2_Figure_10.jpeg) (ii) Various ways of representing 2-bromo butane are: (a) CH3CHBrCH2CH3 (b) $$\\text{(c)}\\quad\\bigvee\\text{(d)}$$ Unit 8.indd 258 10\/10\/2022 10:37:29 AM organic chemistry \u2013 some basic principles and techniques 259 In cyclic compounds, the bond-line formulas may be given as follows: ![](_page_3_Figure_2.jpeg) ![](_page_3_Figure_3.jpeg) chlorocyclohexane # Problem 8.4 Expand each of the following condensed formulas into their complete structural formulas. - (a) CH3CH2COCH2CH3 - (b) CH3CH=CH(CH2) 3CH3 # Solution ![](_page_3_Figure_10.jpeg) # Problem 8.5 For each of the following compounds, write a condensed formula and also their bond-line formula.

For example, by using solid ( ) and dashed ( ) wedge formula, the 3-D image of a molecule from a two-dimensional picture can be perceived. In these formulas the solid-wedge is used to indicate a bond projecting out of the plane of paper, towards the observer. The dashed-wedge is used to depict the bond projecting out of the plane of the paper and away from the observer. Wedges are shown in such a way that the broad end of the wedge is towards the observer. The bonds lying in plane of the paper are depicted by using a normal line (\u2014). 3-D representation of methane molecule on paper has been shown in Fig. 8.1 ![](_page_4_Figure_4.jpeg) *Fig. 8.1 Wedge-and-dash representation of CH4* #### Molecular Models Molecular models are physical devices that are used for a better visualisation and perception of three-dimensional shapes of organic molecules. These are made of wood, plastic or metal and are commercially available. Commonly three types of molecular models are used: (1) *Framework model,* (2) *Ball-and-stick model,* and (3) *Space filling model.* In the *framework model* only the bonds connecting the atoms of a molecule and not the atoms themselves are shown. This model emphasizes the pattern of bonds of a molecule while ignoring the size of atoms. In the *ball-and-stick model,* both the atoms and the bonds are shown. Balls represent atoms and the stick denotes a bond. Compounds containing C=C (e.g., ethene) can best be represented by using springs in place of sticks. These models are referred to as *ball-and-spring model.* The *space-filling model* emphasises the relative size of each atom based on its van der Waals radius. Bonds are not shown in this model. It conveys the volume occupied by each atom in the molecule. In addition to these models, computer graphics can also be used for molecular modelling. ![](_page_4_Figure_8.jpeg) Unit 8.indd 260 11\/10\/2022 15:19:57 #"

In order to clearly identify them, a systematic method of naming has been developed and is known as the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) system of nomenclature. In this systematic nomenclature, the names are correlated with the structure such that the reader or listener can deduce the structure from the name. Before the IUPAC system of nomenclature, however, organic compounds were assigned names based on their origin or certain properties. For instance, citric acid is named so because it is found in citrus fruits and the acid found in red ant is named formic acid since the Latin word for ant is *formica*. These names are traditional and are considered as *trivial* or *common names*. Some common names are followed even today. For example, Buckminsterfullerene is a common name given to the newly discovered C60 cluster (a form of carbon) noting its structural similarity to the geodesic domes popularised by the famous architect R. Buckminster Fuller. Common names are useful and in many cases indispensable, particularly when the alternative systematic names are lengthy and complicated.

Compounds containing carbon and hydrogen only are called hydrocarbons. A hydrocarbon is termed saturated if it contains only carbon-carbon single bonds. The IUPAC name for a homologous series of such compounds is *alkane*. Paraffin (Latin: little affinity) was the earlier name given to these compounds. Unsaturated hydrocarbons are those, which contain at least one carboncarbon double or triple bond. # 8.5.2 IUPAC Nomenclature of Alkanes *Straight chain hydrocarbons*: The names of such compounds are based on their chain structure, and end with suffix '-*ane*' and carry a prefix indicating the number of carbon atoms present in the chain (except from CH4 to C4H10, where the prefixes are derived from trivial names). The IUPAC names of some straight chain saturated hydrocarbons are given in Table 8.2. The alkanes in Table 8.2 differ from each other by merely the number of -CH2 groups in the chain.

The carbon atoms of the parent chain are numbered to identify the parent alkane and to locate the positions of the carbon atoms at which branching takes place due to the substitution of alkyl group in place of hydrogen atoms. The numbering is done in such a way that the branched carbon atoms get the lowest possible numbers. Thus, the numbering in the above example should be from left to right (branching at carbon atoms 2 and 6) and not from right to left (giving numbers 4 and 8 to the carbon atoms at which branches are attached). $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccc} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\\\ \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} & & & & \\\\ \\mid & & & \\mid & & \\mid & & \\\\ \\mathbf{C} & & & \\mid & & \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} & & \\\\ \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} & & & \\\\ \\mid & & & \\mid & & \\mid & \\\\ \\mathbf{C} & & & \\mid & & \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} & & \\\\ \\end{array}$$ 3.

[Note: the numbers are separated from the groups by hyphens and there is no break between methyl and nonane.] 4.

Thus, the following compounds are named as: CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3-CH-CH2-CH-CH3 CH3C CH2CH CH3 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 *2,4-Dimethylpentane 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane* H3C H2C CH3 CH3CH2CHCCH2CH2CH3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 CH3 *3-Ethyl-4,4-dimethylheptane* 5. If the two substituents are found in equivalent positions, the lower number is given to the one coming first in the alphabetical listing.

The carbon atoms of the parent chain are numbered to identify the parent alkane and to locate the positions of the carbon atoms at which branching takes place due to the substitution of alkyl group in place of hydrogen atoms. The numbering is done in such a way that the branched carbon atoms get the lowest possible numbers. Thus, the numbering in the above example should be from left to right (branching at carbon atoms 2 and 6) and not from right to left (giving numbers 4 and 8 to the carbon atoms at which branches are attached). $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccc} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\\\ \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} & & & & \\\\ \\mid & & & \\mid & & \\mid & & \\\\ \\mathbf{C} & & & \\mid & & \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} & & \\\\ \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} & & & \\\\ \\mid & & & \\mid & & \\mid & \\\\ \\mathbf{C} & & & \\mid & & \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{C} & & \\\\ \\end{array}$$ 3. The names of alkyl groups attached as a branch are then prefixed to the name of the parent alkane and position of the substituents is indicated by the appropriate numbers. If different alkyl groups are present, they are listed in alphabetical order. Thus, name for the compound shown above is: 6-ethyl-2 methylnonane. [Note: the numbers are separated from the groups by hyphens and there is no break between methyl and nonane.] 4. If two or more identical substituent groups are present then the numbers are separated by commas.

            "in Table 8.4. First of all, the functional group present in the molecule is identified which determines the choice of appropriate suffix. The longest chain of carbon atoms containing the functional group is numbered in such a way that the functional group is attached at the carbon atom possessing lowest possible number in the chain. By using the suffix as given in Table 8.4, the name of the compound is arrived at. In the case of polyfunctional compounds, one of the functional groups is chosen as the *principal functional group* and the compound is then named on that basis. The remaining functional groups, which are subordinate functional groups, are named as substituents using the appropriate prefixes. The choice of principal functional group is made on the basis of order of preference. The order of decreasing priority for some functional groups is: -COOH, \u2013SO3H, -COOR (R=alkyl group), COCl, -CONH2, -CN,-HC=O, >C=O, -OH, -NH2, > C=C<, -C\u2261C- . The \u2013R, C6H5-, halogens (F, Cl, Br, I), \u2013NO2, alkoxy (\u2013OR) etc. are always prefix substituents. Thus, a compound containing both an alcohol and a keto group is named as hydroxyalkanone since the keto group is preferred to the hydroxyl group. For example, HOCH2(CH2) 3CH2COCH3 will be named as 7-hydroxyheptan-2-one and not as 2-oxoheptan -7-ol. Similarly, BrCH2CH=CH2 is named as 3-bromoprop-1-ene and not 1-bromoprop-2-ene. If more than one functional group of the same type are present, their number is indicated by adding di, tri, etc. before the class suffix. In such cases the full name of the parent alkane is written before the class suffix. For example CH2(OH)CH2(OH) is named as ethane\u20131,2\u2013diol. However, the ending \u2013 ne of the parent alkane is dropped in the case of compounds having more than one double or triple bond; for example, CH2=CH-CH=CH2 is named as buta\u20131,3\u2013diene. #### Problem 8.8 Write the IUPAC names of the compounds i-iv from their given structures. #### Solution - The functional group present is an alcohol (OH). Hence the suffix is '-ol'. - The longest chain containing -OH has eight carbon atoms. Hence the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon is octane. - The -OH is on carbon atom 3. In addition, a methyl group is attached at 6th carbon. Hence, the systematic name of this compound is 6-Methyloctan-3-ol. $$\\begin{array}{ccccc} & & \\mathbf{O} & \\mathbf{O} \\\\ & \\parallel & & \\parallel \\\\ \\mathbf{iii} & \\mathbf{CH\\_3^-CH\\_2^-C^-C^-CH\\_2^-C^-CH\\_3} & \\\\ \\mathbf{6} & \\mathbf{5} & \\mathbf{4} & \\mathbf{3} & \\mathbf{2} & \\mathbf{1} \\end{array}$$ #### Solution The functional group present is ketone (>C=O), hence suffix '-one'.

The keto group in the chain at carbon 5 is indicated by 'oxo'. The longest chain including the principal functional group has 6 carbon atoms; hence the parent hydrocarbon is hexane.

The functional group chloro is present at carbon 2. Hence, the structure of the compound is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH(Cl)CH3. (ii) 'pent' indicates that parent hydrocarbon contains 5 carbon atoms in the chain. 'en' and 'ol' correspond to the functional groups C=C and -OH at carbon atoms 4 and 2 respectively. Thus, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH (OH)CH3.

The keto group in the chain at carbon 5 is indicated by 'oxo'. The longest chain including the principal functional group has 6 carbon atoms; hence the parent hydrocarbon is hexane. The compound is, therefore, named as 5-Oxohexanoic acid. $$\\begin{array}{ccccc} \\text{(iv)} & \\text{CH} \\equiv \\text{C} \\text{--CH=C} \\text{H} \\text{--CH=C} \\text{H} \\text{=CH}\\_2 \\\\ \\text{(6)} & \\text{5} & \\text{4} & \\text{3} & \\text{2} & \\text{1} \\end{array}$$ # Solution The two C=C functional groups are present at carbon atoms 1 and 3, while the C\u2261C functional group is present at carbon 5.

For example, the compound(b) is named as 1,3-dibromobenzene and not as 1,5-dibromobenzene. ![](_page_13_Figure_3.jpeg) In the trivial system of nomenclature the terms *ortho* (*o*), *meta* (*m*) and *para* (*p*) are used as prefixes to indicate the relative positions 1,2;1,3 and 1,4 respectively. Thus, 1,3-dibromobenzene (b) is named as *m*-dibromobenzene (*meta* is abbreviated as *m*-) and the other isomers of dibromobenzene 1,2-(a) and 1,4-(c), are named as *ortho* (or just *o*-) and *para* (or just *p*-)-dibromobenzene, respectively. For tri - or higher substituted benzene derivatives, these prefixes cannot be used and the compounds are named by identifying substituent positions on the ring by following the lowest locant rule. In some cases, common name of benzene derivatives is taken as the base compound. Substituent of the base compound is assigned number1 and then the direction of numbering is chosen such that the next substituent gets the lowest number.

Such compounds are called as isomers. The following flow chart shows different types of isomerism. #### 8.6.1 Structural Isomerism Compounds having the same molecular formula but different structures (manners in which atoms are linked) are classified as structural isomers. Some typical examples of different types of structural isomerism are given below: *(i) Chain isomerism:* When two or more compounds have similar molecular formula but different carbon skeletons, these are referred to as chain isomers and the phenomenon is termed as chain isomerism. For example, C5H12 represents three compounds: ![](_page_14_Figure_13.jpeg) *(ii) Position isomerism:* When two or more compounds differ in the position of substituent atom or functional group on the carbon skeleton, they are called position isomers and this phenomenon is termed as position isomerism.

For example, C4H10O represents methoxypropane (CH3OC3H7) and ethoxyethane (C2H5OC2H5). #### 8.6.2 Stereoisomerism The compounds that have the same constitution and sequence of covalent bonds but differ in relative positions of their atoms or groups in space are called stereoisomers. This special type of isomerism is called as stereoisomerism and can be classified as *geometrical* and optical *isomerism*. # 8.7 FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS IN ORGANIC REACTION MECHANISM In an organic reaction, the organic molecule (also referred as a substrate) reacts with an appropriate attacking reagent and leads to the formation of one or more intermediate(s) and finally product(s) The general reaction is depicted as follows : ![](_page_15_Figure_8.jpeg) Substrate is that reactant which supplies carbon to the new bond and the other reactant is called reagent. If both the reactants supply carbon to the new bond then choice is arbitrary and in that case the molecule on which attention is focused is called *substrate*. In such a reaction a covalent bond between two carbon atoms or a carbon and some other atom is broken and a new bond is formed. A sequential account of each step, describing details of electron movement, energetics during bond cleavage and bond formation, and the rates of transformation of reactants into products (kinetics) is referred to as reaction mechanism.

A species having a carbon atom possessing sextext of electrons and a positive charge is called a *carbocation* (earlier called *carbonium ion)*. The H3 ion is known as a methyl cation or methyl carbonium ion. Carbocations are classified as primary, secondary or tertiary depending on whether one, two or three carbons are directly attached to the positively charged carbon. Some other examples of carbocations are: CH3C + H2 (ethyl cation, a primary carbocation), (CH3) 2C + H (isopropyl cation, a secondary carbocation), and (CH3) 3C + (*tert*-butyl cation, a tertiary carbocation). Carbocations are highly unstable and reactive species. Alkyl groups directly attached to the positively charged carbon stabilise the carbocations due to inductive and hyperconjugation effects, which you will be studying in the sections 8.7.5 and 8.7.9. The observed order of carbocation stability is: C+ H3 < CH3C + H2 < (CH3) 2C + H < (CH3) 3C + . These carbocations have trigonal planar shape with positively charged carbon being *sp*<sup>2<\/sup> hybridised.

For example, when group Z attached to the carbon leaves without electron pair, the methyl anion is formed. Such a carbon species carrying a negative charge on carbon atom is called *carbanion.* Carbon in carbanion is generally sp3 hybridised and its structure is distorted tetrahedron as shown in Fig. 8.3(b). ![](_page_16_Figure_8.jpeg) *Fig. 8.3 (b) Shape of methyl carbanion* Carbanions are also unstable and reactive species. The organic reactions which proceed through heterolytic bond cleavage are called ionic or heteropolar or just polar reactions. In *homolytic cleavage,* one of the electrons of the shared pair in a covalent bond goes with each of the bonded atoms. Thus, in homolytic cleavage, the movement of a single electron takes place instead of an electron pair. The single electron movement is shown by 'half-headed' (fish hook: ) curved arrow. Such cleavage results in the formation of neutral species (atom or group) which contains an unpaired electron. These species are called *free radicals*. Like carbocations and carbanions, free radicals are also very reactive. A homolytic cleavage can be shown as: $$ \\underbrace{\\mathbf{\\hat{R}} \\mathbf{\\hat{D}} \\mathbf{\\hat{X}}}\\_{\\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{\\hat{X}} \\\\ \\mathbf{\\hat{R}} \\end{array}} \\xrightarrow{\\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{\\hat{H}^{\\text{at}}} \\text{ or } \\mathbf{L} \\text{right} \\\\ \\mathbf{\\hat{R}} \\end{array}} \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{\\dot{R}} \\\\ \\mathbf{\\hat{R}} \\end{array} + \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{\\dot{X}} \\\\ \\mathbf{\\dot{X}} \\end{array} $$ Alkyl radicals are classified as *primary*, *secondary*, or *tertiary*.

Molecules as such participate in the reaction. It is convenient to name one reagent as substrate and other as reagent. In general, a molecule whose carbon is involved in new bond formation is called substrate and the other one is called reagent. When carbon-carbon bond is formed, the choice of naming the reactants as substrate and reagent is arbitrary and depends on molecule under observation. Example: (i) CH2 = CH2 + Br2 \u2192 CH2 Br \u2013 CH2Br Substrate Reagent Product ![](_page_16_Figure_20.jpeg) # *Nucleophiles and Electrophiles* Reagents attack the reactive site of the substrate. The reactive site may be electron Unit 8.indd 272 10\/10\/2022 10:37:34 AM deficient portion of the molecule (a positive reactive site) e.g., an atom with incomplete electron shell or the positive end of the dipole in the molecule. If the attacking species is electron rich, it attacks these sites. If attacking species is electron deficient, the reactive site for it is that part of the substrate molecule which can supply electrons, e.g., \u03c0 electrons in a double bond. A reagent that brings an electron pair to the reactive site is called a nucleophile (Nu:) i.e., nucleus seeking and the reaction is then called nucleophilic. A reagent that takes away an electron pair from reactive site is called electrophile (E+) i.e., electron seeking and the reaction is called electrophilic. During a polar organic reaction, a nucleophile attacks an electrophilic centre of the substrate which is that specific atom or part of the substrate which is electron deficient. Similarly, the electrophiles attack at nucleophilic centre, which is the electron rich centre of the substrate. Thus, the electrophiles receive electron pair from the substrate when the two undergo bonding interaction. A curved-arrow notation is used to show the movement of an electron pair from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Some examples of nucleophiles are the negatively charged ions with lone pair of electrons such as hydroxide (HO\u2013 ), cyanide (NC\u2013 ) ions and carbanions (R3C:\u2013 ). Neutral molecules such as etc., can also act as nucleophiles due to the presence of lone pair of electrons. Examples of electrophiles include carbocations (C + H3) and neutral molecules having functional groups like carbonyl group (>C=O) or alkyl halides (R3C-X, where X is a halogen atom). The carbon atom in carbocations has sextet configuration; hence, it is electron deficient and can receive a pair of electrons from the nucleophiles. In neutral molecules such as alkyl halides, due to the polarity of the C-X bond a partial positive charge is generated on the carbon atom and hence the carbon atom becomes"

Thus, in homolytic cleavage, the movement of a single electron takes place instead of an electron pair. The single electron movement is shown by 'half-headed' (fish hook: ) curved arrow. Such cleavage results in the formation of neutral species (atom or group) which contains an unpaired electron. These species are called *free radicals*. Like carbocations and carbanions, free radicals are also very reactive. A homolytic cleavage can be shown as: $$ \\underbrace{\\mathbf{\\hat{R}} \\mathbf{\\hat{D}} \\mathbf{\\hat{X}}}\\_{\\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{\\hat{X}} \\\\ \\mathbf{\\hat{R}} \\end{array}} \\xrightarrow{\\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{\\hat{H}^{\\text{at}}} \\text{ or } \\mathbf{L} \\text{right} \\\\ \\mathbf{\\hat{R}} \\end{array}} \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{\\dot{R}} \\\\ \\mathbf{\\hat{R}} \\end{array} + \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{\\dot{X}} \\\\ \\mathbf{\\dot{X}} \\end{array} $$ Alkyl radicals are classified as *primary*, *secondary*, or *tertiary*. Alkyl radical stability increases as we proceed from primary to tertiary: | , | | | | |---------|---------|-----------|------------| | Methyl | Ethyl | Isopropyl | Tert-butyl | | free | free | free | free | | radical | radical | radical | radical | Organic reactions, which proceed by homolytic fission are called *free radical* or *homopolar* or *nonpolar* reactions. # 8.7.2 Substrate and Reagent Ions are generally not formed in the reactions of organic compounds. Molecules as such participate in the reaction. It is convenient to name one reagent as substrate and other as reagent. In general, a molecule whose carbon is involved in new bond formation is called substrate and the other one is called reagent. When carbon-carbon bond is formed, the choice of naming the reactants as substrate and reagent is arbitrary and depends on molecule under observation. Example: (i) CH2 = CH2 + Br2 \u2192 CH2 Br \u2013 CH2Br Substrate Reagent Product ![](_page_16_Figure_20.jpeg) # *Nucleophiles and Electrophiles* Reagents attack the reactive site of the substrate. The reactive site may be electron Unit 8.indd 272 10\/10\/2022 10:37:34 AM deficient portion of the molecule (a positive reactive site) e.g., an atom with incomplete electron shell or the positive end of the dipole in the molecule. If the attacking species is electron rich, it attacks these sites. If attacking species is electron deficient, the reactive site for it is that part of the substrate molecule which can supply electrons, e.g., \u03c0 electrons in a double bond. A reagent that brings an electron pair to the reactive site is called a nucleophile (Nu:) i.e., nucleus seeking and the reaction is then called nucleophilic. A reagent that takes away an electron pair from reactive site is called electrophile (E+) i.e., electron seeking and the reaction is called electrophilic. During a polar organic reaction, a nucleophile attacks an electrophilic centre of the substrate which is that specific atom or part of the substrate which is electron deficient. Similarly, the electrophiles attack at nucleophilic centre, which is the electron rich centre of the substrate. Thus, the electrophiles receive electron pair from the substrate when the two undergo bonding interaction. A curved-arrow notation is used to show the movement of an electron pair from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Some examples of nucleophiles are the negatively charged ions with lone pair of electrons such as hydroxide (HO\u2013 ), cyanide (NC\u2013 ) ions and carbanions (R3C:\u2013 ). Neutral molecules such as etc., can also act as nucleophiles due to the presence of lone pair of electrons. Examples of electrophiles include carbocations (C + H3) and neutral molecules having functional groups like carbonyl group (>C=O) or alkyl halides (R3C-X, where X is a halogen atom). The carbon atom in carbocations has sextet configuration; hence, it is electron deficient and can receive a pair of electrons from the nucleophiles. In neutral molecules such as alkyl halides, due to the polarity of the C-X bond a partial positive charge is generated on the carbon atom and hence the carbon atom becomes"

It shows how changes in bonding occur due to electronic redistribution during the reaction. To show the change in position of a pair of electrons, curved arrow starts from the point from where an electron pair is shifted and it ends at a location to which the pair of electron may move. Presentation of shifting of electron pair is given below : $$\\begin{aligned} \\text{(i)} & \\stackrel{\\text{\\tiny \\\\_}}{\\longrightarrow} \\stackrel{\\text{\\tiny \\\\_}}{\\longrightarrow} \\longrightarrow -\\text{)} = \\begin{cases} \\text{from } \\pi \\text{ bond to} \\\\ \\text{adjacent bond position} \\end{cases} \\\\ \\text{(ii)} & \\stackrel{\\text{\\tiny \\\\_}}{\\longrightarrow} \\stackrel{\\text{\\tiny \\\\_}}{\\longrightarrow} -\\text{)} - \\text{from } \\pi \\text{ bond to} \\\\ \\text{(iii)} & \\stackrel{\\text{\\tiny \\\\_}}{\\longrightarrow} \\longrightarrow -\\text{)} = \\text{from atom to adjacent} \\end{aligned}$$ Movement of single electron is indicated by a single barbed 'fish hooks' (i.e. half headed curved arrow). For example, in transfer of hydroxide ion giving ethanol and in the dissociation of chloromethane, the movement of electron using curved arrows can be depicted as follows: # 8.7.4 Electron Displacement Effects in Covalent Bonds The electron displacement in an organic molecule may take place either in the ground state under the influence of an atom or a substituent group or in the presence of an appropriate attacking reagent. The electron displacements due to the influence of an atom or a substituent group present in the molecule cause permanent polarlisation of the bond. Inductive effect and resonance effects are examples of this type of electron displacements. Temporary electron displacement effects are seen in a molecule when a reagent approaches to attack it. This type of electron displacement is called electromeric effect or polarisability effect. In the following sections we will learn about these types of electronic displacements. # 8.7.5 Inductive Effect When a covalent bond is formed between atoms of different electronegativity, the electron density is more towards the more electronegative atom of the bond. Such a shift of electron density results in a polar covalent bond. Bond polarity leads to various electronic effects in organic compounds. Let us consider cholorethane (CH3CH2Cl) in which the C\u2013Cl bond is a polar covalent bond. It is polarised in such a way that the carbon-1 gains some positive charge (\u03b4+) and the chlorine some negative charge (\u03b4\u2013 ). The fractional electronic charges on the two atoms in a polar covalent bond are denoted by symbol \u03b4 (delta) and the shift of electron density is shown by an arrow that points from \u03b4+ to \u03b4\u2013 end of the polar bond. $$\\begin{array}{ccccc} \\mathsf{\\delta\\delta^{\\*}} & \\circ & \\mathsf{\\delta\\epsilon^{\\*}} & \\circ & \\mathsf{\\delta^{-}} \\\\ \\mathrm{CH\\_{3}} & \\xrightarrow{\\longrightarrow} & \\mathrm{CH\\_{2}} & \\xrightarrow{\\longrightarrow} & \\mathrm{Cl^{-}} \\\\ 2 & \\longrightarrow & 1 & \\end{array}$$ In turn carbon-1, which has developed partial positive charge (\u03b4+) draws some electron density towards it from the adjacent C-C bond. Consequently, some positive charge (\u03b4\u03b4+) develops on carbon-2 also, where \u03b4\u03b4<sup>+<\/sup> symbolises relatively smaller positive charge as compared to that on carbon \u2013 1. In other words, the polar C \u2013 Cl bond induces polarity in the adjacent bonds. Such polarisation of \u03c3-bond caused by the polarisation of adjacent \u03c3-bond is referred to as the inductive effect. This effect is passed on to the subsequent bonds also but the effect decreases rapidly as the number of intervening bonds increases and becomes vanishingly small after three bonds. The inductive effect is related to the ability of substituent(s) to either withdraw or donate electron density to the attached carbon atom. Based on this ability, the substitutents can be classified as *electron-withdrawing* or *electron donating* groups relative to hydrogen. Halogens and many other groups such as nitro (- NO2), cyano (- CN), carboxy (- COOH), ester (COOR), aryloxy (-OAr, e.g. \u2013 OC6H5), etc. are electron-withdrawing groups. On the other hand, the alkyl groups like methyl (\u2013CH3) and ethyl (\u2013CH2\u2013CH3) are usually considered as electron donating groups.

The effect is transmitted through the chain. There are two types of resonance or mesomeric effect designated as R or M effect. ## *(i) Positive Resonance Effect (+R effect)* In this effect, the transfer of electrons is away from an atom or substituent group attached to the conjugated system. This electron displacement makes certain positions in the molecule of high electron densities. This effect in aniline is shown as : ![](_page_20_Figure_21.jpeg) #### *(ii) Negative Resonance Effect (- R effect)* This effect is observed when the transfer of electrons is towards the atom or substituent group attached to the conjugated system. For example in nitrobenzene this electron displacement can be depicted as : ![](_page_20_Figure_24.jpeg) The atoms or substituent groups, which represent +R or \u2013R electron displacement effects are as follows : +R effect: \u2013 halogen, \u2013OH, \u2013OR, \u2013OCOR, \u2013NH2, \u2013NHR, \u2013NR2, \u2013NHCOR, \u2013 R effect: \u2013 COOH, \u2013CHO, >C=O, \u2013 CN, \u2013NO<sup>2<\/sup> Unit 8.indd 276 10\/10\/2022 10:37:35 AM The presence of alternate single and double bonds in an open chain or cyclic system is termed as a conjugated system. These systems often show abnormal behaviour. The examples are 1,3- butadiene, aniline and nitrobenzene etc. In such systems, the \u03c0-electrons are delocalised and the system develops polarity. #### 8.7.8 Electromeric Effect (E effect) It is a temporary effect. The organic compounds having a multiple bond (a double or triple bond) show this effect in the presence of an attacking reagent only. It is defined as the complete transfer of a shared pair of \u03c0-electrons to one of the atoms joined by a multiple bond on the demand of an attacking reagent. The effect is annulled as soon as the attacking reagent is removed from the domain of the reaction. It is represented by E and the shifting of the electrons is shown by a curved arrow ( ). There are two distinct types of electromeric effect. (i) Positive Eelctromeric Effect (+E effect) In this effect the \u03c0\u2212electrons of the multiple bond are transferred to that atom to which the reagent gets attached. For example: ![](_page_21_Figure_5.jpeg) (ii) Negative Electromeric Effect (\u2013E effect) In this effect the \u03c0 - electrons of the multiple bond are transferred to that atom to which the attacking reagent does not get attached.

Then draw the arrows one at a time moving the electrons to get the other structures. ![](_page_20_Figure_5.jpeg) #### Problem 8.17 Write resonance structures of CH2=CH\u2013CHO. Indicate relative stability of the contributing structures. #### Solution ![](_page_20_Figure_9.jpeg) $$\\mathbf{Stability: I > II > III}$$ [I: Most stable, more number of covalent bonds, each carbon and oxygen atom has an octet and no separation of opposite charge II: negative charge on more electronegative atom and positive charge on more electropositive atom; III: does not contribute as oxygen has positive charge and carbon has negative charge, hence least stable]. #### Problem 8.18 Explain why the following two structures, I and II cannot be the major contributors to the real structure of CH3COOCH3. $$\\begin{array}{ccc} \\cdot & \\bullet & \\cdot\\\\ \\cdot & \\bullet & \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot & \\bullet & \\bullet \\\\ \\cdot & \\bullet & \\bullet \\\\ \\end{array} \\longleftrightarrow \\begin{array}{ccc} \\cdot & \\bullet & \\bullet\\\\ \\cdot & \\bullet & \\bullet \\\\ \\cdot & \\bullet & \\bullet \\\\ \\end{array}$$ #### Solution The two structures are less important contributors as they involve charge separation. Additionally, structure I contains a carbon atom with an incomplete octet. #### 8.7.7 Resonance Effect The resonance effect is defined as 'the polarity produced in the molecule by the interaction of two \u03c0-bonds or between a \u03c0-bond and lone pair of electrons present on an adjacent atom'. The effect is transmitted through the chain. There are two types of resonance or mesomeric effect designated as R or M effect. ## *(i) Positive Resonance Effect (+R effect)* In this effect, the transfer of electrons is away from an atom or substituent group attached to the conjugated system. This electron displacement makes certain positions in the molecule of high electron densities. This effect in aniline is shown as : ![](_page_20_Figure_21.jpeg) #### *(ii) Negative Resonance Effect (- R effect)* This effect is observed when the transfer of electrons is towards the atom or substituent group attached to the conjugated system. For example in nitrobenzene this electron displacement can be depicted as : ![](_page_20_Figure_24.jpeg) The atoms or substituent groups, which represent +R or \u2013R electron displacement effects are as follows : +R effect: \u2013 halogen, \u2013OH, \u2013OR, \u2013OCOR, \u2013NH2, \u2013NHR, \u2013NR2, \u2013NHCOR, \u2013 R effect: \u2013 COOH, \u2013CHO, >C=O, \u2013 CN, \u2013NO<sup>2<\/sup> Unit 8.indd 276 10\/10\/2022 10:37:35 AM The presence of alternate single and double bonds in an open chain or cyclic system is termed as a conjugated system. These systems often show abnormal behaviour. The examples are 1,3- butadiene, aniline and nitrobenzene etc. In such systems, the \u03c0-electrons are delocalised and the system develops polarity. #### 8.7.8 Electromeric Effect (E effect) It is a temporary effect. The organic compounds having a multiple bond (a double or triple bond) show this effect in the presence of an attacking reagent only. It is defined as the complete transfer of a shared pair of \u03c0-electrons to one of the atoms joined by a multiple bond on the demand of an attacking reagent. The effect is annulled as soon as the attacking reagent is removed from the domain of the reaction. It is represented by E and the shifting of the electrons is shown by a curved arrow ( ). There are two distinct types of electromeric effect. (i) Positive Eelctromeric Effect (+E effect) In this effect the \u03c0\u2212electrons of the multiple bond are transferred to that atom to which the reagent gets attached. For example: ![](_page_21_Figure_5.jpeg) (ii) Negative Electromeric Effect (\u2013E effect) In this effect the \u03c0 - electrons of the multiple bond are transferred to that atom to which the attacking reagent does not get attached. For example: ![](_page_21_Figure_7.jpeg) When inductive and electromeric effects operate in opposite directions, the electomeric effect predominates. #### 8.7.9 Hyperconjugation Hyperconjugation is a general stabilising interaction. It involves delocalisation of \u03c3 electrons of C\u2014H bond of an alkyl group directly attached to an atom of unsaturated system or to an atom with an unshared *p* orbital.

        "answer":"Hyperconjugation stabilizes the ethyl cation (CH3CH2+) because one of the C-H bonds of the methyl group can align in the plane of the empty p orbital on the positively charged carbon. The electrons constituting this C-H bond can then be delocalized into the empty p orbital. This overlap disperses the positive charge by allowing electron density from the adjacent sigma bond to contribute, thereby stabilizing the carbocation.",

            "the alkyl group enter into partial conjugation with the attached unsaturated system or with the unshared *p* orbital. Hyperconjugation is a permanent effect. To understand hyperconjugation effect, let us take an example of CH3 C + H2 (ethyl cation) in which the positively charged carbon atom has an empty *p* orbital. One of the C-H bonds of the methyl group can align in the plane of this empty *p* orbital and the electrons constituting the C-H bond in plane with this *p* orbital can then be delocalised into the empty *p* orbital as depicted in Fig. 8.4 (a). ![](_page_21_Figure_13.jpeg) *Fig. 8.4(a) Orbital diagram showing hyperconjugation in ethyl cation* This type of overlap stabilises the carbocation because electron density from the adjacent \u03c3 bond helps in dispersing the positive charge. In general, greater the number of alkyl groups attached to a positively charged carbon atom, the greater is the hyperconjugation interaction and stabilisation of the cation. Thus, we have the following relative stability of carbocations : Unit 8.indd 277 10\/10\/2022 10:37:35 AM 278 chemistry $$\\begin{array}{c} \\text{CH}\\_3\\\\ \\overset{\\text{l}}{\\text{C}} \\text{H}\\_3-\\overset{\\text{l}}{\\text{C}} \\text{ > (CH}\\_3\\overset{+}{\\text{C}}\\text{H} \\text{ > CH}\\_3\\overset{+}{\\text{CH}}\\_2\\text{> } \\overset{+}{\\text{CH}}\\_3\\\\ \\overset{\\text{l}}{\\text{CH}}\\_3 \\end{array}$$ Hyperconjugation is also possible in alkenes and alkylarenes. D e l o c a l i s a t i o n o f e l e c t r o n s b y hyperconjugation in the case of alkene can be depicted as in Fig. 8.4(b). ![](_page_22_Figure_4.jpeg) *Fig. 8.4(b) Orbital diagram showing hyperconjugation in propene* There are various ways of looking at the hyperconjugative effect. One of the way is to regard C\u2014H bond as possessing partial ionic character due to resonance. ![](_page_22_Figure_7.jpeg) The hyperconjugation may also be regarded as no bond resonance. #### Problem 8.19 Explain why (CH3)3C + is more stable than CH3C + H2 and C+ H3 is the least stable cation. #### Solution Hyperconjugation interaction in (CH3) 3C + is greater than in CH3C + H2 as the (CH3) 3C + has nine C-H bonds. In C+ H3, vacant *p* orbital is perpendicular to the plane in which C-H bonds lie; hence cannot overlap with it. Thus, C+ H3 lacks hyperconjugative stability. # 8.7.10 Types of Organic Reactions and Mechanisms Organic reactions can be classified into the following categories: - (i) Substitution reactions - (ii) Addition reactions - (iii) Elimination reactions - (iv) Rearrangement reactions You will be studying these reactions in Unit 9 and later in class XII. # 8.8 Methods of Purification of Organic Compounds Once an organic compound is extracted from a natural source or synthesised in the laboratory, it is essential to purify it. Various methods used for the purification of organic compounds are based on the nature of the compound and the impurity present in it. The common techniques used for purification are as follows : - (i) Sublimation - (ii) Crystallisation - (iii) Distillation - (iv) Differential extraction and - (v) Chromatography Finally, the purity of a compound is ascertained by determining its melting or boiling point. Most of the pure compounds have sharp melting points and boiling points. New methods of checking the purity of an organic compound are based on different Unit 8.indd 278 10\/10\/2022 10:37:35 AM types of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. # 8.8.1 Sublimation You have learnt earlier that on heating, some solid substances change from solid to vapour state without passing through liquid state. The purification technique based on the above principle is known as sublimation and is used to separate sublimable compounds from nonsublimable impurities. ## 8.8.2 Crystallisation This is one of the most commonly used techniques for the purification of solid organic compounds. It is based on the difference in the solubilities of the compound and the impurities in a suitable solvent. The impure compound is dissolved in a solvent in which it is sparingly soluble at room temperature but appreciably soluble at higher temperature. The solution is concentrated to get a nearly saturated solution. On cooling the solution, pure compound crystallises out and is removed by filtration. The filtrate (mother liquor) contains impurities and small quantity of the compound. If the compound is highly soluble in one solvent and very little soluble in another solvent, crystallisation can be satisfactorily carried out in a mixture of these solvents. Impurities, which impart colour to the solution are removed by adsorbing over activated charcoal. Repeated crystallisation becomes necessary for the purification of compounds containing impurities of comparable solubilities. # 8.8.3 Distillation This important method is used to separate (i) volatile liquids from nonvolatile impurities and (ii) the liquids having sufficient difference in their boiling points. Liquids having different boiling points vaporise at different temperatures. The vapours are cooled and the liquids so formed are collected separately. Chloroform (b.p 334 K) and aniline (b.p. 457 K) are easily separated by the technique of distillation (Fig 8.5). The liquid mixture is taken in a round bottom flask and heated carefully. On boiling, the vapours of lower boiling component are formed first. The vapours are condensed by using a condenser and the liquid is collected in a receiver. The vapours of higher boiling component form later and the liquid can be collected separately. ![](_page_23_Figure_9.jpeg) *Fig.8.5 Simple distillation. The vapours of a substance formed are condensed and the liquid is collected in conical flask.* *Fractional Distillation:* If the difference in boiling points of two liquids is not much, simple distillation cannot be used to separate them. The vapours of such liquids are formed within the same temperature range and are condensed simultaneously. The technique of fractional distillation is used in such cases. In this technique, vapours of a liquid mixture are passed through a fractionating column before condensation. The fractionating column is fitted over the mouth of the round bottom flask (Fig.8.6, page 280). Vapours of the liquid with higher boiling point condense before the vapours of the liquid with lower boiling point. The vapours rising up in the fractionating column become richer in more volatile component.
