            "DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMISTRY** Chemistry, as we understand it today, is not a very old discipline. Chemistry was not studied for its own sake, rather it came up as a result of search for two interesting things: *i. Philosopher's stone (Paras)* which would convert all baser metals e.g., iron and copper into gold. *ii. 'Elixir of life'* which would grant immortality. People in ancient India, already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of modern science. They applied that knowledge in various walks of life. Chemistry developed mainly in the form of Alchemy and Iatrochemistry during 1300-1600 CE. Modern chemistry took shape in the 18th century Europe, after a few centuries of alchemical traditions which were introduced in Europe by the Arabs. 2 chemistry Other cultures \u2013 especially the Chinese and the Indian \u2013 had their own alchemical traditions. These included much knowledge of chemical processes and techniques. In ancient India, chemistry was called *Rasayan Shastra, Rastantra, Ras Kriya* or *Rasvidya*. It included metallurgy, medicine, manufacture of cosmetics, glass, dyes, etc. Systematic excavations at Mohenjodaro in Sindh and Harappa in Punjab prove that the story of development of chemistry in India is very old. Archaeological findings show that baked bricks were used in construction work. It shows the mass production of pottery, which can be regarded as the earliest chemical process, in which materials were mixed, moulded and subjected to heat by using fire to achieve desirable qualities. Remains of glazed pottery have been found in Mohenjodaro. Gypsum cement has been used in the construction work. It contains lime, sand and traces of CaCO3. Harappans made faience, a sort of glass which was used in ornaments. They melted and forged a variety of objects from metals, such as lead, silver, gold and copper. They improved the hardness of copper for making artefacts by using tin and arsenic. A number of glass objects were found in Maski in South India (1000\u2013900 BCE), and Hastinapur and Taxila in North India (1000\u2013200 BCE). Glass and glazes were coloured by addition of colouring agents like metal oxides. Copper metallurgy in India dates back to the beginning of chalcolithic cultures in the subcontinent. There are much archeological evidences to support the view that technologies for extraction of copper and iron were developed indigenously. According to *Rigveda,* tanning of leather and dying of cotton were practised during 1000\u2013400 BCE. The golden gloss of the black polished ware of northen India could not be replicated and is still a chemical mystery. These wares indicate the mastery with which kiln temperatures could be controlled. Kautilya's *Arthashastra* describes the production of salt from sea. A vast number of statements and material described in the ancient Vedic literature can be shown to agree with modern scientific findings. Copper utensils, iron, gold, silver ornaments and terracotta discs and painted grey pottery have been found in many archaeological sites in north India. *Sushruta Samhita* explains the importance of Alkalies. The *Charaka Samhita* mentions ancient indians who knew how to prepare sulphuric acid, nitric acid and oxides of copper, tin and zinc; the sulphates of copper, zinc and iron and the carbonates of lead and iron. *Rasopanishada* describes the preparation of gunpowder mixture. Tamil texts also describe the preparation of fireworks using sulphur, charcoal, saltpetre (i.e., potassium nitrate), mercury, camphor, etc. Nagarjuna was a great Indian scientist. He was a reputed chemist, an alchemist and a metallurgist. His work *Rasratnakar* deals with the formulation of mercury compounds. He has also discussed methods for the extraction of metals, like gold, silver, tin and copper. A book, *Rsarnavam*, appeared around 800 CE. It discusses the uses of various furnaces, ovens and crucibles for different purposes. It describes methods by which metals could be identified by flame colour. *Chakrapani* discovered mercury sulphide. The credit for inventing soap also goes to him. He used mustard oil and some alkalies as ingredients for making soap. Indians began making soaps in the 18th century CE. Oil of *Eranda* and seeds of *Mahua* plant and calcium carbonate were used for making soap. The paintings found on the walls of Ajanta and Ellora, which look fresh even after ages, testify to a high level of science achieved in ancient India. Var\u00e4hmihir's *Brihat Samhita* is a sort of encyclopaedia, which was composed in the sixth century CE. It informs about the preparation of glutinous material to be applied on walls and roofs of houses and temples. It was prepared entirely from extracts of various plants, fruits, seeds and barks, which were concentrated by boiling, and then, treated with various resins. It will be interesting to test such materials scientifically and assess them for use. Unit 1.indd 2 9\/9\/2022 4:27:29 PM #### Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry 3 A number of classical texts, like *Atharvaveda* (1000 BCE) mention some dye stuff, the material used were turmeric, *madder*, sunflower, orpiment, cochineal and lac. Some other substances having tinting property were *kamplcica, pattanga* and *jatuka*. Var\u00e4hmihir's *Brihat Samhita* gives references to perfumes and cosmetics. Recipes for hair dying were made from plants, like indigo and minerals like iron power, black iron or steel and acidic extracts of sour rice gruel. *Gandhayukli* describes recipes for making scents, mouth perfumes, bath powders, incense and talcum power. Paper was known to India in the 17th century as account of Chinese traveller I-tsing describes. Excavations at Taxila indicate that ink was used in India from the fourth century. Colours of ink were made from chalk, red lead and minimum. It seems that the process of fermentation was well-known to Indians*.* Vedas and Kautilya's *Arthashastra* mention about many types of liquors. *Charaka Samhita* also mentions ingredients, such as barks of plants, stem, flowers, leaves, woods, cereals, fruits and sugarcane for making *Asavas.* The concept that matter is ultimately made of indivisible building blocks, appeared in India a few centuries BCE as a part of philosophical speculations. Acharya Kanda, born in 600 BCE, originally known by the name Kashyap, was the first proponent of the 'atomic theory'. He"

            "![](_page_0_Picture_0.jpeg) ![](_page_0_Picture_1.jpeg) # ** SOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY** After studying this unit, you will be able to - appreciate the contribution of India in the development of chemistry understand the role of chemistry in different spheres of life; - explain the characteristics of three states of matter; - classify different substances into elements, compounds and mixtures; - use scientific notations and determine significant figures; - differentiate between precision and accuracy; - define SI base units and convert physical quantities from one system of units to another; - explain various laws of chemical combination; - appreciate significance of atomic mass, average atomic mass, molecular mass and formula mass; - describe the terms mole and molar mass; - calculate the mass per cent of component elements constituting a compound; - determine empirical formula and molecular formula for a compound from the given experimental data; and - perform the stoichiometric calculations. *Chemistry is the science of molecules and their transformations. It is the science not so much of the one hundred elements but of the infinite variety of molecules that may be built from them.* *Roald Hoffmann* Science can be viewed as a continuing human effort to systematise knowledge for describing and understanding nature. You have learnt in your previous classes that we come across diverse substances present in nature and changes in them in daily life. Curd formation from milk, formation of vinegar from sugarcane juice on keeping for prolonged time and rusting of iron are some of the examples of changes which we come across many times. For the sake of convenience, science is sub-divided into various disciplines: chemistry, physics, biology, geology, etc. The branch of science that studies the preparation, properties, structure and reactions of material substances is called chemistry. ### ** formulated the theory of very small indivisible particles, which he named '*Param\u00e3nu*' (comparable to atoms). He authored the text *Vaiseshika Sutras*. According to him, all substances are aggregated form of smaller units called atoms (*Param\u00e3nu*), which are eternal, indestructible, spherical, suprasensible and in motion in the original state. He explained that this individual entity cannot be sensed through any human organ. Kanda added that there are varieties of atoms that are as different as the different classes of substances. He said these (*Param\u00e3nu*) could form pairs or triplets, among other combinations and unseen forces cause interaction between them. He conceptualised this theory around 2500 years before John Dalton (1766-1844). *Charaka Samhita* is the oldest Ayurvedic epic of India. It describes the treatment of diseases. The concept of reduction of particle size of metals is clearly discussed in *Charaka Samhita*. Extreme reduction of particle size is termed as nanotechnology. *Charaka Samhita* describes the use of *bhasma* of metals in the treatment of ailments. Now-a-days, it has been proved that *bhasmas* have nanoparticles of metals. After the decline of alchemy, Iatrochemistry reached a steady state, but it too declined due to the introduction and practise of western medicinal system in the 20th century. During this period of stagnation, pharmaceutical industry based on Ayurveda continued to exist, but it too declined gradually. It took about 100-150 years for Indians to learn and adopt new techniques. During this time, foreign products poured in. As a result, indigenous traditional techniques gradually declined. Modern science appeared in Indian scene in the later part of the nineteenth century. By the mid-nineteenth century, European scientists started coming to India and modern chemistry started growing. From the above discussion, you have learnt that chemistry deals with the composition, structure, properties and interection of matter and is of much use to human beings in daily life. These aspects can be best described and understood in terms of basic constituents of matter that are **atoms** and **molecules**. That is why, chemistry is also called the science of atoms and molecules. Can we see, weigh and perceive these entities (atoms and molecules)? Is it possible to count the number of atoms and molecules in a given mass of matter and have a quantitative relationship between the mass and the number of these particles? We will get the answer of some of these questions in this Unit. We will further describe how physical properties of matter can be quantitatively described using numerical values with suitable units.

            "1.1 IMPORTANCE OF CHEMISTRY** Chemistry plays a central role in science and is often intertwined with other branches of science. Principles of chemistry are applicable in diverse areas, such as weather patterns, functioning of brain and operation of a computer, production in chemical industries, manufacturing fertilisers, alkalis, acids, salts, dyes, polymers, drugs, soaps, detergents, metals, alloys, etc., including new material. Chemistry contributes in a big way to the national economy. It also plays an important role in meeting human needs for food, healthcare products and other material aimed at improving the quality of life. This is exemplified by the large-scale production of a variety of fertilisers, improved variety of pesticides and insecticides. Chemistry provides methods for the isolation of lifesaving drugs from natural sources and makes possible synthesis of such drugs. Some of these drugs are **cisplatin** and **taxol**, which are effective in cancer therapy. The drug AZT (Azidothymidine) is used for helping AIDS patients. Chemistry contributes to a large extent in the development and growth of a nation. With a better understanding of chemical principles it has now become possible to design and synthesise new material having specific magnetic, electric and optical properties. This has lead to the production of superconducting ceramics, conducting polymers, optical fibres, etc. Chemistry has helped in establishing industries which manufacture utility goods, like acids, alkalies, dyes, polymesr metals, etc. These industries contribute in a big way to the economy of a nation and generate employment. In recent years, chemistry has helped in dealing with some of the pressing aspects of environmental degradation with a fair degree of success. Safer alternatives to environmentally hazardous refrigerants, like CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), responsible for ozone depletion in the stratosphere, have been successfully synthesised. However, many big environmental problems continue to be matters of grave concern to the chemists. One such problem is the management of the Green House gases, like methane, carbon dioxide, etc. Understanding of biochemical processes, use of enzymes for large-scale production of chemicals and synthesis of new exotic material are some of the intellectual challenges for the future generation of chemists. A developing country, like India, needs talented and creative chemists for accepting such challenges. To be a good chemist and to accept such challanges, one needs to understand the basic concepts of chemistry, which begin with the concept of matter. Let us start with the nature of matter. #### **"

        "contexts":[
            "1.2 Nature of Matter** You are already familiar with the term **matter** from your earlier classes. Anything which has mass and occupies space is called **matter**. Everything around us, for example, book, pen, pencil, water, air, all living beings, etc., are composed of matter. You know that they have mass and they occupy space. Let us recall the characteristics of the states of matter, which you learnt in your previous classes. #### **1.2.1 States of Matter** You are aware that matter can exist in three physical states *viz.* **solid**, **liquid** and **gas**. The constituent particles of matter in these three states can be represented as shown in Fig. 1.1. Particles are held very close to each other in **solids** in an orderly fashion and there is not much freedom of movement. In **liquids**, the particles are close to each other but they can move around. However, in **gases**, the particles are far apart as compared to those present in solid or liquid states and their movement is easy and fast. Because of such arrangement of particles, different states of matter exhibit the following characteristics: - (i) Solids have *definite volume* and *definite shape*. - (ii) Liquids have *definite volume* but *do not* have *definite shape*. They take the shape of the container in which they are placed. Unit 1.indd 4 9\/9\/2022 4:27:29 PM ![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg) *Fig. 1.2 Classification of matter Fig. 1.1 Arrangement of particles in solid, liquid and gaseous state* (iii) Gases have *neither definite volume nor definite shape*. They completely occupy the space in the container in which they are placed. These three states of matter are interconvertible by changing the conditions of temperature and pressure. Solid liquid Gas On heating, a solid usually changes to a liquid, and the liquid on further heating changes to gas (or vapour). In the reverse process, a gas on cooling liquifies to the liquid and the liquid on further cooling freezes to the solid. #### **1.2.2. Classification of Matter** In Class IX (Chapter 2), you have learnt that at the macroscopic or bulk level, matter can be classified as **mixture** or **pure substance**. These can be further sub-divided as shown in Fig. 1.2. When all constituent particles of a substance are same in chemical nature, it is said to be a pure substance. A mixture contains many types of particles. **A mixture** contains particles of two or more pure substances which may be present in it in any ratio. Hence, their composition is variable. Pure substances forming mixture are called its components. Many of the substances present around you are **mixtures**. For example, sugar solution in water, air, tea, etc., are all mixtures. A mixture may be **homogeneous** or **heterogeneous**. In a **homogeneous mixture**, the components ![](_page_4_Figure_11.jpeg) completely mix with each other. This means particles of components of the mixture are uniformly distributed throughout the bulk of the mixture and its composition is uniform throughout. Sugar solution and air are the examples of homogeneous mixtures. In contrast to this, in a **heterogeneous mixture**, the composition is not uniform throughout and sometimes different components are visible. For example, mixtures of salt and sugar, grains and pulses along with some dirt (often stone pieces), are heterogeneous mixtures. You can think of many more examples of mixtures which you come across in the daily life. It is worthwhile to mention here that the components of a mixture can be separated by using physical methods, such as simple hand-picking, filtration, crystallisation, distillation, etc. **Pure substances** have characteristics different from mixtures. Constituent particles of pure substances have fixed composition. Copper, silver, gold, water and glucose are some examples of pure substances. Glucose contains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in a fixed ratio and its particles are of same composition. Hence, like all other pure substances, glucose has a fixed composition. Also, its constituents\u2014carbon, hydrogen and oxygen\u2014cannot be separated by simple physical methods. Pure substances can further be classified into **elements** and **compounds**. Particles of an **element** consist of only one type of atoms. These particles may exist as **atoms** or **molecules**. You may be familiar with atoms Unit 1.indd 5 9\/9\/2022 4:27:30 PM 6 chemistry and molecules from the previous classes; however, you will be studying about them in detail in Unit 2. Sodium, copper, silver, hydrogen, oxygen, etc., are some examples of elements. Their all atoms are of one type. However, the atoms of different elements are different in nature. Some elements, such as sodium or copper, contain atoms as their constituent particles, whereas, in some others, the constituent particles are molecules which are formed by two or more atoms. For example, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen gases consist of molecules, in which two atoms combine to give their respective molecules. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.3. ![](_page_5_Figure_2.jpeg) *Fig. 1.3 A representation of atoms and molecules* When two or more atoms of different elements combine together in a definite ratio, the molecule of a **compound** is obtained. Moreover, the constituents of a compound cannot be separated into simpler substances by physical methods. They can be separated by chemical methods. Examples of some compounds are water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, sugar, etc. The molecules of water and carbon dioxide are represented in Fig. 1.4. Note that a water molecule comprises two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Similarly, a molecule of carbon dioxide contains two oxygen atoms combined with one carbon atom. Thus, the atoms of different ![](_page_5_Figure_6.jpeg) *Fig. 1.4 A depiction of molecules of water and carbon dioxide* elements are present in a compound in a fixed and definite ratio and this ratio is characteristic of a particular compound. Also, the properties of a compound are different from those of its constituent elements. For example, hydrogen and oxygen are gases, whereas, the compound formed by their combination i.e., water is a liquid. It is interesting to note that hydrogen burns with a pop sound and oxygen is a supporter of combustion, but water is used as a fire extinguisher. # **"

It was established by the Metre Convention, signed in Paris in 1875. The CGPM established the International System of Units (SI), which has seven base units pertaining to fundamental scientific quantities. This system was established in 1960 to provide a common standard system for scientific measurement, addressing the need for a unified approach to quantifying physical properties like length, mass, and time.",

            "1.3 Properties of Matter and their Measurement** #### **1.3.1 Physical and chemical properties** Every substance has unique or characteristic properties. These properties can be classified into two categories \u2014 **physical properties,** such as colour, odour, melting point, boiling point, density, etc., and **chemical properties,** like composition, combustibility, ractivity with acids and bases, etc. **Physical properties** can be measured or observed without changing the identity or the composition of the substance. The measurement or observation of **chemical properties** requires a chemical change to occur. Measurement of physical properties does not require occurance of a chemical change. The examples of chemical properties are characteristic reactions of different substances; these include acidity or basicity, combustibility, etc. Chemists describe, interpret and predict the behaviour of substances on the basis of knowledge of their physical and chemical properties, which are determined by careful measurement and experimentation. In the following section, we Unit 1.indd 6 9\/9\/2022 4:27:30 PM will learn about the measurement of physical properties. #### **1.3.2 Measurement of physical properties** Quantitative measurement of properties is reaquired for scientific investigation. Many properties of matter, such as length, area, volume, etc., are quantitative in nature. Any quantitative observation or measurement is represented by a number followed by units in which it is measured. For example, length of a room can be represented as 6 m; here, 6 is the number and m denotes metre, the unit in which the length is measured. Earlier, two different systems of measurement, i.e., the **English System** and the **Metric System** were being used in different parts of the world. The metric system, which originated in France in late eighteenth century, was more convenient as it was based on the decimal system. Late, need of a common standard system was felt by the scientific community. Such a system was established in 1960 and is discussed in detail below. #### **1.3.3 The International System of Units (SI)** The International System of Units (in French *Le Systeme International d'Unit\u00e9s* \u2014 abbreviated as SI) was established by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM from *Conference Generale des Poids et Measures*). The CGPM is an inter- #### **Maintaining the National Standards of Measurement** The system of units, including unit definitions, keeps on changing with time. Whenever the accuracy of measurement of a particular unit was enhanced substantially by adopting new principles, member nations of metre treaty (signed in 1875), agreed to change the formal definition of that unit. Each modern industrialised country, including India, has a National Metrology Institute (NMI), which maintains standards of measurements. This responsibility has been given to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi. This laboratory establishes experiments to realise the *base units* and *derived units* of measurement and maintains National Standards of Measurement. These standards are periodically inter-compared with standards maintained at other National Metrology Institutes in the world, as well as those, established at the International Bureau of Standards in Paris. governmental treaty organisation created by a diplomatic treaty known as Metre Convention, which was signed in Paris in 1875. **The SI system has seven** *base units* and they are listed in Table 1.1.

The mass of a substance is constant, whereas, its weight may vary from one place to another due to change in gravity. You should be careful in using these terms. The mass of a substance can be determined accurately in the laboratory by using an analytical balance (Fig. 1.5). The SI unit of mass as given in Table 1.1 is kilogram. However, its fraction named as gram (1 kg = 1000 g), is used in laboratories due to the smaller amounts of chemicals used in chemical reactions. #### **1.3.5 Volume** Volume is the amont of space occupied by a substance. It has the units of (length)3. So in ![](_page_8_Figure_9.jpeg) SI system, volume has units of m3. But again, in chemistry laboratories, smaller volumes are used. Hence, volume is often denoted in cm3 or dm3 units. A common unit, litre (L) which is not an SI unit, is used for measurement of volume of liquids. 1 L = 1000 mL, 1000 cm3 = 1 dm3 Fig. 1.6 helps to visualise these relations. ![](_page_8_Figure_13.jpeg) *Fig. 1.6 Different units used to express volume* Unit 1.indd 9 9\/9\/2022 4:27:31 PM In the laboratory, the volume of liquids or solutions can be measured by graduated cylinder, burette, pipette, etc. A volumetric flask is used to prepare a known volume of a solution. These measuring devices are shown in Fig. 1.7. ![](_page_9_Figure_2.jpeg) *Fig. 1.7 Some volume measuring devices* #### **1.3.6 Density** The two properties \u2014 mass and volume discussed above are related as follows: $$\\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Volume}}$$ Density of a substance is its amount of mass per unit volume. So, SI units of density can be obtained as follows: $$\\text{SI unit of density} = \\frac{\\text{SI unit of mass}}{\\text{SI unit of volume}}$$ $$=\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^3} \\text{ or kg } \\text{m}^{-3}$$ This unit is quite large and a chemist often expresses density in g cm\u20133, where mass is expressed in gram and volume is expressed in cm3. Density of a substance tells us about how closely its particles are packed. If density is more, it means particles are more closely packed. # **1.3.7 Temperature** There are three common scales to measure temperature \u2014 \u00b0C (degree celsius), \u00b0F (degree fahrenheit) and K (kelvin). Here, K is the SI unit. The thermometers based on these scales are shown in Fig. 1.8. Generally, the thermometer with celsius scale are calibrated from 0\u00b0 to 100\u00b0, where these two temperatures are the freezing point and the boiling point of water, respectively. The fahrenheit scale is represented between 32\u00b0 to 212\u00b0. The temperatures on two scales are related to each other by the following relationship: $${}^{\\circ}\\text{F} = \\frac{9}{5}({}^{\\circ}\\text{C}) + 32$$ The kelvin scale is related to celsius scale as follows: K = \u00b0C + 273.15 It is interesting to note that temperature below 0 \u00b0C (i.e., negative values) are possible in Celsius scale but in Kelvin scale, negative temperature is not possible. ![](_page_9_Figure_19.jpeg) *Fig. 1.8 Thermometers using different temperature scales* #### **1.4 Uncertainty in Measurement** Many a time in the study of chemistry, one has to deal with experimental data as well as theoretical calculations. There are meaningful ways to handle the numbers conveniently and Unit 1.indd 10 9\/9\/2022 4:27:32 PM #### **Reference Standard** After defining a unit of measurement such as the kilogram or the metre, scientists agreed on reference standards that make it possible to calibrate all measuring devices. For getting reliable measurements, all devices such as *metre sticks* and *analytical balances* have been calibrated by their manufacturers to give correct readings. However, each of these devices is standardised or calibrated against some reference. The mass standard is the kilogram since 1889. It has been defined as the mass of platinum-iridium (Pt-Ir) cylinder that is stored in an airtight jar at International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Sevres, France. Pt-Ir was chosen for this standard because it is highly resistant to chemical attack and its mass will not change for an extremely long time. Scientists are in search of a new standard for mass. This is being attempted through accurate determination of Avogadro constant. Work on this new standard focuses on ways to measure"

One such method, which uses X-rays to determine the atomic density of a crystal of ultrapure silicon, has an accuracy of about 1 part in 106 but has not yet been adopted to serve as a standard. There are other methods but none of them are presently adequate to replace the Pt-Ir cylinder. No doubt, changes are expected within this decade. The metre was originally defined as the length between two marks on a Pt-Ir bar kept at a temperature of 0\u00b0C (273.15 K). In 1960 the length of the metre was defined as 1.65076373\u00d7106 times the wavelength of light emitted by a krypton laser. Although this was a cumbersome number, it preserved the length of the metre at its agreed value. The metre was redefined in 1983 by CGPM as the length of path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1\/299 792 458 of a second. Similar to the length and the mass, there are reference standards for other physical quantities. present the data realistically with certainty to the extent possible. These ideas are discussed below in detail. #### **1.4.1 Scientific Notation** As chemistry is the study of atoms and molecules, which have extremely low masses and are present in extremely large numbers, a chemist has to deal with numbers as large as 602, 200,000,000,000,000,000,000 for the molecules of 2 g of hydrogen gas or as small as 0.00000000000000000000000166 g mass of a H atom. Similarly, other constants such as Planck's constant, speed of light, charges on particles, etc., involve numbers of the above magnitude. It may look funny for a moment to write or count numbers involving so many zeros but it offers a real challenge to do simple mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division with such numbers. You can write any two numbers of the above type and try any one of the operations you like to accept as a challenge, and then, you will really appreciate the difficulty in handling such numbers. This problem is solved by using scientific notation for such numbers, i.e., exponential notation in which any number can be represented in the form N \u00d710n, where n is an exponent having positive or negative values and N is a number (called digit term) which varies between 1.000... and 9.999.... Thus, we can write 232.508 as 2.32508 \u00d7102 in scientific notation. Note that while writing it, the decimal had to be moved to the left by two places and same is the exponent (2) of 10 in the scientific notation. Similarly, 0.00016 can be written as 1.6 \u00d7 10\u20134. Here, the decimal has to be moved four places to the right and (\u20134) is the exponent in the scientific notation. While performing mathematical operations on numbers expressed in scientific notations, the following points are to be kept in mind. Unit 1.indd 11 9\/9\/2022 4:27:32 PM # *Multiplication and Division* These two operations follow the same rules which are there for exponential numbers, i.e. $$\\begin{aligned} \\left(5.6 \\times 10^{5}\\right) \\times \\left(6.9 \\times 10^{8}\\right) &= \\left(5.6 \\times 6.9\\right) \\left(10^{5+8}\\right) \\\\ &= \\left(5.6 \\times 6.9\\right) \\times 10^{13} \\\\ &= 38.64 \\times 10^{13} \\\\ &= 3.864 \\times 10^{14} \\\\ \\left(9.8 \\times 10^{-2}\\right) \\times \\left(2.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\right) &= \\left(9.8 \\times 2.5\\right) \\left(10^{-2+(-6)}\\right) \\\\ &= \\left(9.8 \\times 2.5\\right) \\left(10^{-2-6}\\right) \\\\ &= 24.50 \\times 10^{-8} \\\\ &= 2.450 \\times 10^{-7} \\\\ \\frac{2.7 \\times 10^{-3}}{5.5 \\times 10^{4}} &= \\left(2.7 \\div 5.5\\right) \\left(10^{-3-4}\\right) = 0.4909 \\times 10^{-7} \\\\ &= 4.909 \\times 10^{-8} \\end{aligned}$$ #### *Addition and Subtraction* For these two operations, first the numbers are written in such a way that they have the same exponent. After that, the coefficients (digit terms) are added or subtracted as the case may be. Thus, for adding 6.65\u00d7104 and 8.95\u00d7103, exponent is made same for both the numbers. Thus, we get (6.65\u00d7104) + (0.895\u00d7104) Then, these numbers can be added as follows (6.65 + 0.895)\u00d7104 = 7.545\u00d7104 Similarly, the subtraction of two numbers can be done as shown below: - (2.5 \u00d7 10\u20132) (4.8 \u00d710\u20133) - = (2.5 \u00d710\u20132) (0.48 \u00d710\u20132) - = (2.5 0.48)\u00d710\u20132 = 2.02 \u00d710\u20132 #### **1.4.2 Significant Figures** Every experimental measurement has some amount of uncertainty associated with it because of limitation of measuring instrument and the skill of the person making the measurement. For example, mass of an object is obtained using a platform balance and it comes out to be 9.4g. On measuring the mass of this object on an analytical balance, the mass obtained is 9.4213g. The mass obtained by an analytical balance is slightly higher than the mass obtained by using a platform balance. Therefore, digit 4 placed after decimal in the measurement by platform balance is uncertain. The uncertainty in the experimental or the calculated values is indicated by mentioning the number of significant figures. **Significant figures** are meaningful digits which are known with certainty plus one which is estimated or uncertain. The uncertainty is indicated by writing the certain digits and the last uncertain digit. Thus, if we write a result as 11.2 mL, we say the 11 is certain and 2 is uncertain and the uncertainty would be +1 in the last digit. Unless otherwise stated, an uncertainty of +1 in the last digit is always understood. There are certain rules for determining the number of significant figures. These are stated below: - (1) All non-zero digits are significant. For example in 285 cm, there are three significant figures and in 0.25 mL, there are two significant figures. - (2) Zeros preceding to first non-zero digit are not significant. Such zero indicates the position of decimal point. Thus, 0.03 has one significant figure and 0.0052 has two significant figures. - (3) Zeros between two non-zero digits are significant. Thus, 2.005 has four significant figures. - (4) Zeros at the end or right of a number are significant, provided they are on the right side of the decimal point. For example, 0.200 g has three significant figures. But, if otherwise,"

        "question":"As a JEE Chemistry Professor, can you explain the concept of dimensional analysis and its application in unit conversion, particularly in the context of the term '1.4.3'?",
        "answer":"Dimensional analysis, also known as the factor label method or unit factor method, is a technique used for converting units from one system to another. This is achieved by multiplying a given quantity by unit factors, which are derived from equivalence statements between different units. For example, to convert inches to centimeters, we use the equivalence 1 inch = 2.54 cm, which allows us to form unit factors like $\\frac{1\\text{ in}}{2.54\\,\\text{cm}}$ or $\\frac{2.54\\,\\text{cm}}{1\\,\\text{in}}$. Multiplying the given quantity by the appropriate unit factor cancels out the original units and introduces the desired units. This method is applicable to more complex conversions, such as converting volume units, by cubing unit factors as needed. The term '1.4.3' in the context of the provided text refers to the section discussing Dimensional Analysis.",

            "the terminal zeros are not significant if there is no decimal point. For example, 100 has only one significant figure, but 100 has three significant figures and 100.0 has four significant figures. Such numbers are better represented in scientific notation. We can express the number 100 as 1\u00d7102 for one significant figure, 1.0\u00d7102 for two significant figures and 1.00\u00d7102 for three significant figures. Unit 1.indd 12 9\/9\/2022 4:27:32 PM (5) Counting the numbers of object, for example, 2 balls or 20 eggs, have infinite significant figures as these are exact numbers and can be represented by writing infinite number of zeros after placing a decimal i.e., 2 = 2.000000 or 20 = 20.000000. In numbers written in scientific notation, all digits are significant e.g., 4.01\u00d7102 has three significant figures, and 8.256\u00d710\u20133 has four significant figures. However, one would always like the results to be precise and accurate. Precision and accuracy are often referred to while we talk about the measurement. **Precision** refers to the closeness of various measurements for the same quantity. However, **accuracy** is the agreement of a particular value to the true value of the result. For example, if the true value for a result is 2.00 g and student 'A' takes two measurements and reports the results as 1.95 g and 1.93 g. These values are precise as they are close to each other but are not accurate. Another student 'B' repeats the experiment and obtains 1.94 g and 2.05 g as the results for two measurements. These observations are neither precise nor accurate. When the third student 'C' repeats these measurements and reports 2.01 g and 1.99 g as the result, these values are both precise and accurate. This can be more clearly understood from the data given in Table 1.4. #### **Table 1.4 Data to Illustrate Precision and Accuracy** | Measurements\/g | | | | |----------------|------|------|-------------| | | 1 | 2 | Average (g) | | Student A | 1.95 | 1.93 | 1.940 | | Student B | 1.94 | 2.05 | 1.995 | | Student C | 2.01 | 1.99 | 2.000 | # *Addition and Subtraction of Significant Figures* The result cannot have more digits to the right of the decimal point than either of the original numbers. 12.11 | 18.0 | |--------| | 1.012 | | 31.122 | | | Here, 18.0 has only one digit after the decimal point and the result should be reported only up to one digit after the decimal point, which is 31.1. # *Multiplication and Division of Significant Figures* In these operations, the result must be reported with no more significant figures as in the measurement with the few significant figures. 2.5\u00d71.25 = 3.125 Since 2.5 has two significant figures, the result should not have more than two significant figures, thus, it is 3.1. While limiting the result to the required number of significant figures as done in the above mathematical operation, one has to keep in mind the following points for rounding off the numbers - 1. If the rightmost digit to be removed is more than 5, the preceding number is increased by one. For example, 1.386. If we have to remove 6, we have to round it to 1.39. - 2. If the rightmost digit to be removed is less than 5, the preceding number is not changed. For example, 4.334 if 4 is to be removed, then the result is rounded upto 4.33. - 3. If the rightmost digit to be removed is 5, then the preceding number is not changed if it is an even number but it is increased by one if it is an odd number. For example, if 6.35 is to be rounded by removing 5, we have to increase 3 to 4 giving 6.4 as the result. However, if 6.25 is to be rounded off it is rounded off to 6.2. #### **1.4.3 Dimensional Analysis** Often while calculating, there is a need to convert units from one system to the other. The method used to accomplish this is called **factor label method** or **unit factor method** or **dimensional analysis**. This is illustrated below. #### **Example** A piece of metal is 3 inch (represented by in) long. What is its length in cm? Unit 1.indd 13 9\/9\/2022 4:27:32 PM # **Solution** We know that 1 in = 2.54 cm From this equivalence, we can write $$\\frac{1\\text{ in}}{2.54\\,\\text{cm}} = 1 = \\frac{2.54\\,\\text{cm}}{1\\,\\text{in}}$$ $$\\text{Thus, } \\frac{1\\text{ in}}{2.54\\,\\text{cm}} \\text{ equals } 1 \\text{ and } \\frac{2.54\\,\\text{cm}}{1\\,\\text{in}}$$ also equals 1. Both of these are called **unit factors**. If some number is multiplied by these unit factors (i.e., 1), it will not be affected otherwise. Say, the 3 in given above is multiplied by the unit factor. So, 3 in = 3 in \u00d7 2 54 1 . cm in = 3 \u00d7 2.54 cm = 7.62cm Now, the unit factor by which multiplication is to be done is that unit factor ( 2 54 1 . cm in in the above case) which gives the desired units i.e., the numerator should have that part which is required in the desired result. It should also be noted in the above example that units can be handled just like other numerical part. It can be cancelled, divided, multiplied, squared, etc. Let us study one more example. # **Example** A jug contains 2L of milk. Calculate the volume of the milk in m3. # **Solution** Since 1 L = 1000 cm3 and 1m = 100 cm, which gives $$\\frac{1\\text{ m}}{100\\text{ cm}} = 1 = \\frac{100\\text{ cm}}{1\\text{ m}}$$ To get m3 from the above unit factors, the first unit factor is taken and it is cubed. $$\\left(\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{m}}{100\\,\\mathrm{cm}}\\right)^3 \\Rightarrow \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{m}^3}{10^6\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3} = \\left(1\\right)^3 = 1$$ Now 2 L = 2 \u00d71000 cm3 The above is multiplied by the unit factor <sup>2<\/sup> <sup>1000<\/sup> <sup>1<\/sup> 10 2 10 2 10 <sup>3<\/sup> 3 6 3 3 3 3 3 cm m cm m m # **Example** How many seconds are there in 2 days? # **Solution** Here, we know 1"

He performed careful experimental studies for combustion reactions and reached to the conclusion that in all physical and chemical changes, there is no net change in mass duting the process. Hence, he reached to the conclusion that matter can neither be created nor destroyed. This is called 'Law of Conservation of Mass'. This law formed the basis for several later developments in chemistry. Infact, this was the result of exact measurement of masses of reactants and products, and carefully planned experiments performed by Lavoisier. Unit 1.indd 14 9\/9\/2022 4:27:33 PM #### **1.5.2 Law of Definite Proportions** This law was given by, a French chemist, Joseph Proust. He stated that *a given compound always contains exactly the same proportion of elements by weight.* ![](_page_14_Picture_3.jpeg) Proust worked with two samples of cupric carbonate \u2014 one of which was of natural Joseph Proust (1754\u20131826) origin and the other was synthetic. He found that the composition of elements present in it was same for both the samples as shown below: | | % of<br>copper | % of<br>carbon | % of<br>oxygen | |------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------| | Natural Sample | 51.35 | 9.74 | 38.91 | | Synthetic Sample | 51.35 | 9.74 | 38.91 | Thus, he concluded that irrespective of the source, a given compound always contains same elements combined together in the same proportion by mass. The validity of this law has been confirmed by various experiments. It is sometimes also referred to as **Law of Definite Composition**. #### **1.5.3 Law of Multiple Proportions** This law was proposed by Dalton in 1803. According to this law, *if two elements can combine to form more than one compound, the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other element, are in the ratio of small whole numbers.* For example, hydrogen combines with oxygen to form two compounds, namely, water and hydrogen peroxide. $$\\begin{array}{c} \\text{Hydrogen} + \\text{Oxygen} \\rightarrow \\text{Water} \\\\ 2\\text{g} & 16\\text{g} \\\\ \\text{Hydrogen} + \\text{Oxygen} \\rightarrow \\text{Hydrogen Peroxide} \\\\ \\dots & \\dots \\end{array}$$ 2g 32g 34g Here, the masses of oxygen (i.e., 16 g and 32 g), which combine with a fixed mass of hydrogen (2g) bear a simple ratio, i.e., 16:32 or 1: 2. #### **1.5.4 Gay Lussac's Law of Gaseous Volumes** This law was given by Gay Lussac in 1808. He observed that *when gases combine or* *are produced in a chemical reaction they do so in a simple ratio by volume, provided all gases are at the same temperature and pressure.* Thus, 100 mL of hydrogen combine with 50 mL of oxygen to give 100 mL of water vapour. ![](_page_14_Picture_18.jpeg) Joseph Louis Gay Lussac Hydrogen + Oxygen \u2192 Water 100 mL 50 mL 100 mL Thus, the volumes of hydrogen and oxygen which combine (i.e., 100 mL and 50 mL) bear a simple ratio of 2:1. Gay Lussac's discovery of integer ratio in volume relationship is actually the law of definite proportions by volume. The law of definite proportions, stated earlier, was with respect to mass. The Gay Lussac's law was explained properly by the work of Avogadro in 1811. #### **1.5.5 Avogadro's Law** In 1811, Avogadro proposed that *equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure should contain equal number of molecules.* Avogadro made a distinction between **atoms** and **molecules** which is quite understandable in present times. If we consider again the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to produce water, we see that two volumes of hydrogen combine with one volume of oxygen to give two volumes of water without leaving any unreacted oxygen. Note that in the Fig. 1.9 (Page 16) each box contains equal number of molecules. In fact, Avogadro could explain the above result by considering the molecules to be **polyatomic.** If hydrogen and oxygen were considered as **diatomic** as recognised now, then the above results are easily understandable. However, Dalton and others believed at that time that atoms of the same kind ![](_page_14_Picture_27.jpeg) Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro di Quareqa edi Carreto (1776\u20131856) Unit 1.indd 15 9\/9\/2022 4:27:34 PM ![](_page_15_Figure_1.jpeg) *Fig. 1.9 Two volumes of hydrogen react with one volume of oxygen to give two volumes of water vapour* cannot combine and molecules of oxygen or hydrogen containing two atoms did not exist. Avogadro's proposal was published in the French *Journal de Physique*. In spite of being correct, it did not gain much support. After about 50 years, in 1860, the first international conference on chemistry was held in Karlsruhe, Germany, to resolve various ideas. At the meeting, Stanislao Cannizaro presented a sketch of a course of chemical philosophy, which emphasised on the importance of Avogadro's work. #### **1.6 Dalton's Atomic Theory** Although the origin of the idea that matter is composed of small indivisible particles called *'a-tomio'* (meaning, *indivisible*), dates back to the time of Democritus, a Greek Philosopher (460\u2013 370 BC), it again started emerging as a result of several experimental studies which led to the laws mentioned above. ![](_page_15_Picture_8.jpeg) In 1808, Dalton published 'A New System of Chemical Philosophy', in which he proposed the following : John Dalton (1776\u20131884) 1.

Compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in a fixed ratio. - 4. Chemical reactions involve reorganisation of atoms. These are neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Dalton's theory could explain the laws of chemical combination. However, it could not explain the laws of gaseous volumes. It could not provide the reason for combining of atoms, which was answered later by other scientists. ## **1.7 Atomic and Molecular Masses** After having some idea about the terms atoms and molecules, it is appropriate here to understand what do we mean by atomic and molecular masses. #### **1.7.1 Atomic Mass** The atomic mass or the mass of an atom is actually very-very small because atoms are extremely small. Today, we have sophisticated techniques e.g., mass spectrometry for determining the atomic masses fairly accurately. But in the nineteenth century, scientists could determine the mass of one atom **relative** to another by experimental means, as has been mentioned earlier. Hydrogen, being the lightest atom was arbitrarily assigned a mass of 1 (without any units) and other elements were assigned masses relative to it. However, the present system of atomic masses is based on carbon-12 as the standard and has been agreed upon in 1961. Here, Carbon-12 is one of the **isotopes** of carbon and can be represented as 12C. In this system, 12C is assigned a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass unit (**amu**) and masses of all other atoms are given relative to this standard. One **atomic mass unit** is defined as a mass exactly equal to one-twelfth of the mass of one carbon \u2013 12 atom. Unit 1.indd 16 9\/9\/2022 4:27:34 PM And 1 amu = 1.66056\u00d710\u201324 g Mass of an atom of hydrogen = 1.6736\u00d710\u201324 g Thus, in terms of amu, the mass of hydrogen atom = = 1.0078 amu = 1.0080 amu Similarly, the mass of oxygen - 16 (16O) atom would be 15.995 amu. At present, **'amu'** has been replaced by **'u'**, which is known as **unified mass**. When we use atomic masses of elements in calculations, we actually use *average atomic masses* of elements, which are explained below. #### **1.7.2 Average Atomic Mass** Many naturally occurring elements exist as more than one isotope. When we take into account the existence of these isotopes and their relative abundance (per cent occurrence), the average atomic mass of that element can be computed. For example, carbon has the following three isotopes with relative abundances and masses as shown against each of them. | Isotope | Relative<br>Abundance<br>(%) | Atomic Mass<br>(amu) | |---------|------------------------------|----------------------| | 12C | 98.892 | 12 | | 13C | 1.108 | 13.00335 | | 14C | 2 \u00d710\u201310 | 14.00317 | From the above data, the average atomic mass of carbon will come out to be: (0.98892) (12 u) + (0.01108) (13.00335 u) + (2 \u00d710\u201312) (14.00317 u) = 12.011 u Similarly, average atomic masses for other elements can be calculated. In the periodic table of elements, the atomic masses mentioned for different elements actually represent their average atomic masses. #### **1.7.3 Molecular Mass** Molecular mass is the sum of atomic masses of the elements present in a molecule. It is obtained by multiplying the atomic mass of each element by the number of its atoms and adding them together. For example, molecular mass of methane, which contains one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms, can be obtained as follows: Molecular mass of methane, $$(\\text{CH}\\_4) = (12.011 \\text{ u}) + 4 \\text{ (1.008 u)}$$ = 16.043 u Similarly, molecular mass of water (H2O) = 2 \u00d7 atomic mass of hydrogen + 1\u00d7 atomic mass of oxygen = 2 (1.008 u) + 16.00 u = 18.02 u #### **1.7.4 Formula Mass** Some substances, such as sodium chloride, do not contain discrete molecules as their constituent units. In such compounds, positive (sodium ion) and negative (chloride ion) entities are arranged in a three-dimensional structure, as shown in Fig. 1.10. ![](_page_16_Picture_25.jpeg) *Fig. 1.10 Packing of Na+ and Cl\u2013 ions in sodium chloride* It may be noted that in sodium chloride, one Na+ ion is surrounded by six Cl\u2013 ion and *vice-versa*. The formula, such as NaCl, is used to calculate the **formula mass** instead of molecular mass as in the solid state sodium chloride does not exist as a single entity. Unit 1.indd 17 9\/9\/2022 4:27:35 PM Thus, the formula mass of sodium chloride is atomic mass of sodium + atomic mass of chlorine = 23.0 u + 35.5 u = 58.5 u #### **Problem 1.1** Calculate the molecular mass of glucose (C6H12O6) molecule. #### **Solution** Molecular mass of glucose (C6H12O6) = 6 (12.011 u) + 12 (1.008 u) + 6 (16.00 u) = (72.066 u) + (12.096 u) + (96.00 u) = 180.162 u #### **1.8 Mole concept and Molar Masses** Atoms and molecules are extremely small in size and their numbers in even a small amount of any substance is really very large. To handle such large numbers, a unit of convenient magnitude is required. Just as we denote one dozen for 12 items, score for 20 items, gross for 144 items, we use the idea of mole to count entities at the microscopic level (i.e., atoms, molecules, particles, electrons, ions, etc). In SI system, **mole** (symbol, mol) was introduced as seventh base quantity for the amount of a substance. The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole contains exactly 6.02214076 \u00d71023 elementary entities. This number is the fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, NA, when expressed in the unit mol\u20131 and is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance, symbol *n*, of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron, any other particle or specified group of particles. It may be emphasised that the mole of a substance"

To appreciate the largeness of this number, let us write it with all zeroes without using any powers of ten. 602213670000000000000000 Hence, so many entities (atoms, molecules or any other particle) constitute one mole of a particular substance.

But many a time, information regarding the percentage of a particular element present in a compound is required. Suppose, an unknown or new compound is given to you, the first question ![](_page_17_Picture_23.jpeg) *Fig. 1.11 One mole of various substances* Unit 1.indd 18 9\/9\/2022 4:27:35 PM you would ask is: what is its formula or what are its constituents and in what ratio are they present in the given compound? For known compounds also, such information provides a check whether the given sample contains the same percentage of elements as present in a pure sample. In other words, one can check the purity of a given sample by analysing this data. Let us understand it by taking the example of water (H2O). Since water contains hydrogen and oxygen, the percentage composition of both these elements can be calculated as follows: Mass % of an element = mass of that element in the compound 100 molar mass of th \u00d7 e compound Molar mass of water = 18.02 g | Mass % of hydrogen | = | |--------------------|----------------------------------------| | Mass % of oxygen | = 11.18<br>16.00<br>\u00d7100<br>=<br>18.02 | | | =<br>88.79 | Let us take one more example. What is the percentage of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in ethanol? Molecular formula of ethanol is: C2H5OH Molar mass of ethanol is: (2\u00d712.01 + 6\u00d71.008 + 16.00) g = 46.068 g Mass per cent of carbon = 24.02g 46.068g \u00d7100 = 52.14% Mass per cent of hydrogen = $$\\frac{6.048\\,\\mathrm{g}}{46.068\\,\\mathrm{g}} \\times 100 = 13.13\\%$$ Mass per cent of oxygen $$=\\frac{16.00\\,\\text{g}}{46.068\\,\\text{g}} \\times 100 = 34.73\\%$$ After understanding the calculation of per cent of mass, let us now see what information can be obtained from the per cent composition data. # **1.9.1 Empirical Formula for Molecular Formula** An **empirical formula** represents the simplest whole number ratio of various atoms present in a compound, whereas, the **molecular formula** shows the exact number of different types of atoms present in a molecule of a compound. If the mass per cent of various elements present in a compound is known, its empirical formula can be determined. Molecular formula can further be obtained if the molar mass is known. The following example illustrates this sequence. #### **Problem 1.2** A compound contains 4.07% hydrogen, 24.27% carbon and 71.65% chlorine. Its molar mass is 98.96 g. What are its empirical and molecular formulas? #### **Solution** #### **Step 1. Conversion of mass per cent to grams** Since we are having mass per cent, it is convenient to use 100 g of the compound as the starting material. Thus, in the 100 g sample of the above compound, 4.07g hydrogen, 24.27g carbon and 71.65g chlorine are present. #### **Step 2. Convert into number moles of each element** Divide the masses obtained above by respective atomic masses of various elements. This gives the number of moles of constituent elements in the compound Moles of hydrogen = 4.07 <sup>g<\/sup> 1.008g = 4.04 Moles of carbon = 24.27 <sup>g<\/sup> 12 01g <sup>2<\/sup> <sup>021<\/sup> . <sup>=<\/sup> . $$\\text{Moles of chlorine} = \\frac{71.65 \\,\\text{g}}{35.453 \\,\\text{g}} = 2.021 \\,\\text{g}$$ Unit 1.indd 19 9\/9\/2022 4:27:36 PM # **Step 3. Divide each of the mole values obtained above by the smallest number amongst them** Since 2.021 is smallest value, division by it gives a ratio of 2:1:1 for H:C:Cl. In case the ratios are not whole numbers, then they may be converted into whole number by multiplying by the suitable coefficient. # **Step 4. Write down the empirical formula by mentioning the numbers after writing the symbols of respective elements** CH2Cl is, thus, the empirical formula of the above compound. # **Step 5. Writing molecular formula** (a) Determine empirical formula mass by adding the atomic masses of various atoms present in the empirical formula. For CH2Cl, empirical formula mass is 12.01 + (2 \u00d71.008) + 35.453 = 49.48 g (b) Divide Molar mass by empirical formula mass = 2 = (*n*) (c) Multiply empirical formula by *n* obtained above to get the molecular formula Empirical formula = CH2Cl, *n* = 2. Hence molecular formula is C2H4Cl2. # **1.10 Stoichiometry and Stoichiometric Calculations** The word 'stoichiometry' is derived from two Greek words \u2014 *stoicheion* (meaning, *element*) and *metron* (meaning, *measure*).

            "of reactants required or the products produced in a chemical reaction, let us study what information is available from the **balanced** chemical equation of a given reaction. Let us consider the combustion of methane. A balanced equation for this reaction is as given below: CH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) \u2192 CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g) Here, methane and dioxygen are called *reactants* and carbon dioxide and water are called *products*. Note that all the reactants and the products are gases in the above reaction and this has been indicated by letter (g) in the brackets next to its formula. Similarly, in case of solids and liquids, (s) and (l) are written respectively. The coefficients 2 for O2 and H2O are called stoichiometric coefficients. Similarly the coefficient for CH4 and CO2 is one in each case. They represent the number of molecules (and moles as well) taking part in the reaction or formed in the reaction. Thus, according to the above chemical reaction, - \u2022 One **mole** of CH4(g) reacts with two **moles** of O2(g) to give one **mole** of CO2(g) and two **moles** of H2O(g) - \u2022 One **molecule** of CH4(g) reacts with 2 **molecules** of O2(g) to give one **molecule** of CO2(g) and 2 molecules of H2O(g) - \u2022 22.7 L of CH4(g) reacts with 45.4 L of O<sup>2<\/sup> (g) to give 22.7 L of CO2 (g) and 45.4 L of H2O(g) - \u2022 16 g of CH4 (g) reacts with 2\u00d732 g of O2 (g) to give 44 g of CO2 (g) and 2\u00d718 g of H2O (g). From these relationships, the given data can be interconverted as follows: # mass Mass Volume <sup>=<\/sup> Density # **1.10.1 Limiting Reagent** Many a time, reactions are carried out with the amounts of reactants that are different than the amounts as required by a balanced chemical reaction. In such situations, one reactant is in more amount than the amount required by balanced chemical reaction. The Unit 1.indd 20 9\/9\/2022 4:27:36 PM reactant which is present in the least amount gets consumed after sometime and after that further reaction does not take place whatever be the amount of the other reactant. Hence, the reactant, which gets consumed first, limits the amount of product formed and is, therefore, called the **limiting reagent**. In performing stoichiometric calculations, this aspect is also to be kept in mind. # **1.10.2 Reactions in Solutions** A majority of reactions in the laboratories are carried out in solutions. Therefore, it is important to understand as how the amount of substance is expressed when it is present in the solution. The concentration of a solution or the amount of substance present in its given volume can be expressed in any of the following ways. - 1. Mass per cent or weight per cent (w\/w %) - 2. Mole fraction - 3. Molarity - 4. Molality Let us now study each one of them in detail. #### **Balancing a chemical equation** According to the law of conservation of mass, a balanced chemical equation has the *same number of atoms of each element on both sides* of the equation. Many chemical equations can be balanced by *trial and error*.

However equation (c) is not balanced. In this equation, phosphorus atoms are balanced but not the oxygen atoms. To balance it, we must place the coefficient 5 on the left of oxygen on the left side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms appearing on the right side of the equation.

Step 1 Write down the correct formulas of reactants and products. Here, propane and oxygen are reactants, and carbon dioxide and water are products. C3H8(g) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2 (g) + H2O(l) unbalanced equation **Step 2** *Balance the number of C atoms:* Since 3 carbon atoms are in the reactant, therefore, three CO2 molecules are required on the right side.

Molarity* It is the most widely used unit and is denoted by M. It is defined as the number of moles of the solute in 1 litre of the solution. Thus, Molarity (M) <sup>=<\/sup> No. of moles of solute Volume of solution in litres Suppose, we have 1 M solution of a substance, say NaOH, and we want to prepare a 0.2 M solution from it. 1 M NaOH means 1 mol of NaOH present in 1 litre of the solution. For 0.2 M solution, we require 0.2 moles of NaOH dissolved in 1 litre solution. Hence, for making 0.2M solution from 1M solution, we have to take that volume of 1M NaOH solution, which contains 0.2 mol of NaOH and dilute the solution with water to 1 litre. Now, how much volume of concentrated (1M) NaOH solution be taken, which contains 0.2 moles of NaOH can be calculated as follows: If 1 mol is present in 1L or 1000 mL solution then, 0.2 mol is present in $$\\frac{1000\\,\\text{mL}}{1\\,\\text{mol}} \\times 0.2\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{solution}$$ = 200 mL solution Thus, 200 mL of 1M NaOH are taken and enough water is added to dilute it to make it 1 litre. In fact for such calculations, a general formula, M1\u00d7*V*1 = M2\u00d7 V2 where M and *V* are molarity and volume, respectively, can be used. In this case, M1 is equal to 0.2M; *V*1 = 1000 mL and, M2 = 1.0M; V2 is to be calculated.

People in ancient India, already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of modern science. They applied the knowledge in various walks of life. The study of chemistry is very important as its domain encompasses every sphere of life. Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes undergone by them. All substances contain matter, which can exist in three states \u2013 solid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these states of matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties. Matter can also be classified into elements, compounds or mixtures. An **element** contains particles of only one type, which may be **atoms** or **molecules**. The compounds are formed where atoms of two or more elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other. Mixtures occur widely and many of the substances present around us are mixtures. When the properties of a substance are studied, measurement is inherent. The quantification of properties requires a system of measurement and units in which the quantities are to be expressed. Many systems of measurement exist, of which the English Unit 1.indd 24 11\/30\/2022 14:49:36 and the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however, has agreed to have a uniform and common system throughout the world, which is abbreviated as SI units (International System of Units). Since measurements involve recording of data, which are always associated with a certain amount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the quantities is very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread over a wide range of 10\u201331 to 10+23. Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers in **scientific notation** is used. The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number of **significant figures,** in which the observations are reported. The **dimensional analysis** helps to express the measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible to interconvert the results from one system of units to another. The combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination \u2014 these being the **Law of Conservation of Mass, Law of Definite Proportions, Law of Multiple Proportions, Gay Lussac's Law of Gaseous Volumes** and **Avogadro Law**. All these laws led to the **Dalton's atomic theory,** which states that atoms are building blocks of matter. The **atomic mass** of an element is expressed relative to 12C isotope of carbon, which has an exact value of 12u. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element is the **average atomic mass** obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of different isotopes of that element. The **molecular mass** of a molecule is obtained by taking sum of the atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The **molecular formula** can be calculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present in a compound and its molecular mass. The number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are expressed in the terms of **Avogadro constant** (6.022 \u00d7 1023). This is known as **1 mol** of the respective particles or entities. Chemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements and compounds. A **balanced** chemical equation provides a lot of information. The coefficients indicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part in a particular reaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called **stoichiometry**. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amount of one or more reactant(s) required to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice-versa. The amount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is expressed in number of ways, e.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality. #### **exerciseS** - 1.1 Calculate the molar mass of the following: - (i) H2O (ii) CO2 (iii) CH<sup>4<\/sup> - 1.2 Calculate the mass per cent of different elements present in sodium sulphate (Na2SO4). - 1.3 Determine the empirical formula of an oxide of iron, which has 69.9% iron and 30.1% dioxygen by mass. - 1.4 Calculate the amount of carbon dioxide that could be produced when - (i) 1 mole of carbon is burnt in air. - (ii) 1 mole of carbon is burnt in 16 g of dioxygen. - (iii) 2 moles of carbon are burnt in 16 g of dioxygen. - 1.5 Calculate the mass of sodium acetate (CH3COONa) required to make 500 mL of 0.375 molar aqueous solution.

            "2.1 Discovery of Sub-atomic Particles** An insight into the structure of atom was obtained from the experiments on electrical discharge through gases. Before we discuss these results we need to keep in mind a basic rule regarding the behaviour of charged particles : \"Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other\". #### **2.1.1 Discovery of Electron** In 1830, Michael Faraday showed that if electricity is passed through a solution of an electrolyte, chemical reactions occurred at the electrodes, which resulted in the liberation and deposition of matter at the electrodes. He formulated certain laws which you will study in Class XII. These results suggested the particulate nature of electricity. In mid 1850s many scientists mainly Faraday began to study electrical discharge in partially evacuated tubes, known as **cathode ray discharge tubes**. It is depicted in Fig. 2.1. A cathode ray tube is made of glass containing two thin pieces of metal, called electrodes, sealed in it. The electrical discharge through the gases could be observed only at very low pressures and at very high voltages. The pressure of different gases could be adjusted by evacuation of the glass tubes. When sufficiently high voltage is applied across the electrodes, current starts flowing through a stream of particles moving in the tube from the negative electrode (cathode) to the positive electrode (anode). These were called **cathode rays or cathode ray particles**. The flow of current from cathode to anode was further checked by making a hole in the anode and coating the tube behind anode with phosphorescent material zinc sulphide. When these rays, after passing through anode, strike the zinc sulphide coating, a bright spot is developed on the coating [Fig. 2.1(b)]. ![](_page_1_Figure_6.jpeg) *Fig. 2.1(a) A cathode ray discharge tube* ![](_page_1_Figure_8.jpeg) *Fig. 2.1(b) A cathode ray discharge tube with perforated anode* The results of these experiments are summarised below. - (i) The cathode rays start from cathode and move towards the anode. - (ii) These rays themselves are not visible but their behaviour can be observed with the help of certain kind of materials (fluorescent or phosphorescent) which glow when hit by them. Television picture tubes are cathode ray tubes and television pictures result due to fluorescence on the television screen coated with certain fluorescent or phosphorescent materials. - (iii) In the absence of electrical or magnetic field, these rays travel in straight lines (Fig. 2.2). - (iv) In the presence of electrical or magnetic field, the behaviour of cathode rays are similar to that expected from negatively charged particles, suggesting that the cathode rays consist of negatively charged particles, called **electrons.** - (v) The characteristics of cathode rays (electrons) do not depend upon the Unit 2.indd 30 9\/9\/2022 4:28:08 PM material of electrodes and the nature of the gas present in the cathode ray tube. *Thus, we can conclude that electrons are basic constituent of all the atoms.* #### **2.1.2 Charge to Mass Ratio of Electron** In 1897, British physicist J.J. Thomson measured the ratio of electrical charge (*e*) to the mass of electron (*m*e ) by using cathode ray tube and applying electrical and magnetic field perpendicular to each other as well as to the path of electrons (Fig. 2.2). When only electric field is applied, the electrons deviate from their path and hit the cathode ray tube at point A (Fig. 2.2). Similarly when only magnetic field is applied, electron strikes the cathode ray tube at point C. By carefully balancing the electrical and magnetic field strength, it is possible to bring back the electron to the path which is followed in the absence of electric or magnetic field and they hit the screen at point B. Thomson argued that the amount of deviation of the particles from their path in the presence of electrical or magnetic field depends upon: - (i) the magnitude of the negative charge on the particle, greater the magnitude of the charge on the particle, greater is the interaction with the electric or magnetic field and thus greater is the deflection. - (ii) the mass of the particle lighter the particle, greater the deflection. By carrying out accurate measurements on the amount of deflections observed by the electrons on the electric field strength or magnetic field strength, Thomson was able to determine the value of *e\/m*<sup>e<\/sup> as: the strength of the magnetic field. $$\\frac{e}{m\\_e} = 1.758820 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ C kg}^{-1} \\tag{2.1}$$ Where *m*<sup>e<\/sup> is the mass of the electron in kg and *e* is the magnitude of the charge on the electron in coulomb (C). Since electrons are negatively charged, the charge on electron is \u2013*e*. #### **2.1.3 Charge on the Electron** R.A. Millikan (1868-1953) devised a method known as oil drop experiment (1906-14), to determine the charge on the electrons. He found the charge on the electron to be \u2013 1.6 \u00d7 10\u201319 C. The present accepted value of electrical charge is \u2013 1.602176 \u00d7 10\u201319 C. The mass of the electron (*m*<sup>e<\/sup> ) was determined by combining these results with Thomson's value of *e*\/*m*<sup>e<\/sup> ratio. $$\\mathrm{m\\_e} = \\frac{\\mathrm{e}}{\\mathrm{e}\/\\mathrm{m\\_e}} = \\frac{1.602176 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}}{1.758820 \\times 10^{11} \\mathrm{C} \\ \\mathrm{kg^{-1}}}$$ $$= 9.1094 \\times 10^{-31} \\,\\mathrm{kg} \\tag{2.2}$$ ![](_page_2_Figure_14.jpeg) *Fig. 2.2 The apparatus to determine the charge to the mass ratio of electron* Unit 2.indd 31 9\/9\/2022 4:28:08 PM # **2.1.4 Discovery of Protons and Neutrons** Electrical discharge carried out in the modified cathode ray tube led to the discovery of **canal rays** carrying positively charged particles. The characteristics of these positively charged particles are listed below. - (i) Unlike cathode rays, mass of positively charged particles depends upon the nature of gas present in the cathode ray tube. These are simply the positively charged gaseous ions. - (ii) The charge to mass ratio of the particles depends on the gas from which these originate. - (iii) Some of the positively charged particles carry a multiple of the fundamental unit of electrical charge. - (iv) The behaviour of these particles in the magnetic or electrical field is opposite to that observed for"

The downward motion of these droplets was viewed through the telescope, equipped with a micrometer eye piece. By measuring the rate of fall of these droplets, Millikan was able to measure the mass of oil droplets. The air inside the chamber was ionized by passing a beam of X-rays through it. The electrical charge on these oil droplets was acquired by collisions with gaseous ions. The fall of these charged oil droplets can be retarded, accelerated or made stationary depending upon the charge on the droplets and the polarity and strength of the voltage applied to the plate. By carefully measuring the effects of electrical field strength on the motion of oil droplets, Millikan concluded that the magnitude of electrical charge, *q*, on the droplets is always an integral multiple of the electrical charge, e, that is, *q = n* e, where n = 1, 2, 3... . ![](_page_3_Figure_14.jpeg) - *Fig. 2.3 The Millikan oil drop apparatus for measuring charge 'e'.

Although some of these models were not able to explain the stability of atoms, two of these models, one proposed by J.J. Thomson and the other proposed by Ernest Rutherford are discussed below. #### **2.2.1 Thomson Model of Atom** J. J. Thomson, in 1898, proposed that an atom possesses a spherical shape (radius approximately 10\u201310 m) in which the positive charge is uniformly distributed. The electrons are embedded into it in such a manner as to give the most stable electrostatic arrangement (Fig. 2.4). Many different names are given to this model, for example, **plum pudding, raisin pudding or watermelon**. This model ![](_page_4_Figure_6.jpeg) *Fig.2.4 Thomson model of atom* can be visualised as a pudding or watermelon of positive charge with plums or seeds (electrons) embedded into it. *An important feature of this model is that the mass of the atom is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the atom*. Although this model was able to explain the overall neutrality of the atom, but was not consistent with the results of later experiments. Thomson was awarded Nobel Prize for physics in 1906, for his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases. In the later half of the nineteenth century different kinds of rays were discovered, besides those mentioned earlier. Wilhalm R\u00f6entgen (1845-1923) in 1895 showed that when electrons strike a material in the cathode ray tubes, produce rays which can cause fluorescence in the fluorescent materials placed outside the cathode ray tubes. Since R\u00f6entgen did not know the nature of the radiation, he named them X-rays and the name is still carried on. It was noticed that X-rays are produced effectively when electrons strike the dense metal anode, called targets. These are not deflected by the electric and magnetic fields and have a very high penetrating power through the matter and that is the reason that these rays are used to study the interior of the objects. These rays are of very short wavelengths (\u223c0.1 nm) and possess electro-magnetic character (Section 2.3.1). Henri Becqueral (1852-1908) observed that there are certain elements which emit radiation on their own and named this phenomenon as **radioactivity** and the elements known as **radioactive elements.** This field was developed by Marie Curie, Piere Curie, Rutherford and Fredrick Soddy. It was observed that three kinds of rays i.e., \u03b1, \u03b2- and \u03b3-rays are emitted. Rutherford found that \u03b1-rays consists of high energy particles carrying two units of positive charge and four unit of atomic mass. He concluded that \u03b1- particles are helium nuclei as when \u03b1particles combined with two electrons yielded helium gas. \u03b2-rays are negatively charged Unit 2.indd 33 9\/9\/2022 4:28:08 PM particles similar to electrons. The \u03b3-rays are high energy radiations like X-rays, are neutral in nature and do not consist of particles. As regards penetrating power, \u03b1-particles are the least, followed by \u03b2-rays (100 times that of \u03b1\u2013particles) and \u03b3-rays (1000 times of that \u03b1-particles). ## **2.2.2 Rutherford's Nuclear Model of Atom** Rutherford and his students (Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden) bombarded very thin gold foil with \u03b1\u2013particles.

            "was directed at a thin foil (thickness \u223c 100 nm) of gold metal. The thin gold foil had a circular fluorescent zinc sulphide screen around it. Whenever \u03b1\u2013particles struck the screen, a tiny flash of light was produced at that point. The results of scattering experiment were quite unexpected. According to Thomson model of atom, the mass of each gold atom in the foil should have been spread evenly over the entire atom, and \u03b1\u2013particles had enough energy to pass directly through such a uniform distribution of mass. It was expected that the particles would slow down and change directions only by a small angles as they passed through the foil. It was observed that: - (i) most of the \u03b1\u2013particles passed through the gold foil undeflected. - (ii) a small fraction of the \u03b1\u2013particles was deflected by small angles. - (iii) a very few \u03b1\u2013particles (\u223c1 in 20,000) bounced back, that is, were deflected by nearly 180\u00b0 . On the basis of the observations, Rutherford drew the following conclusions regarding the structure of atom: - (i) Most of the space in the atom is empty as most of the \u03b1\u2013particles passed through the foil undeflected. - (ii) A few positively charged \u03b1\u2013particles were deflected. The deflection must be due to enormous repulsive force showing that the positive charge of the atom is not spread throughout the atom as Thomson had presumed. The positive charge has to be concentrated in a very small volume that repelled and deflected the positively charged \u03b1\u2013particles. - (iii) Calculations by Rutherford showed that the volume occupied by the nucleus is negligibly small as compared to the total volume of the atom. The radius of the atom is about 10\u201310 m, while that of nucleus is 10\u201315 m. One can appreciate this difference in size by realising that if Unit 2.indd 34 9\/9\/2022 4:28:08 PM a cricket ball represents a nucleus, then the radius of atom would be about 5 km. On the basis of above observations and conclusions, Rutherford proposed the nuclear model of atom. According to this model: - (i) The positive charge and most of the mass of the atom was densely concentrated in extremely small region. This very small portion of the atom was called **nucleus** by Rutherford. - (ii) The nucleus is surrounded by electrons that move around the nucleus with a very high speed in circular paths called **orbits**. Thus, Rutherford's model of atom resembles the solar system in which the nucleus plays the role of sun and the electrons that of revolving planets. - (iii) Electrons and the nucleus are held together by electrostatic forces of attraction. ## **2.2.3 Atomic Number and Mass Number** The presence of positive charge on the nucleus is due to the protons in the nucleus. As established earlier, the charge on the proton is equal but opposite to that of electron. The number of protons present in the nucleus is equal to atomic number (*Z* ). For example, the number of protons in the hydrogen nucleus is 1, in sodium atom it is 11, therefore their atomic numbers are 1 and 11 respectively. In order to keep the electrical neutrality, the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons (atomic number, *Z* ). For example, number of electrons in hydrogen atom and sodium atom are 1 and 11 respectively. # **Atomic number (***Z***) = number of protons in the nucleus of an atom = number of electrons in a nuetral atom** (2.3) While the positive charge of the nucleus is due to protons, the mass of the nucleus, due to protons and neutrons. As discussed earlier protons and neutrons present in the nucleus are collectively known as **nucleons**. The total number of nucleons is termed as **mass number (A)** of the atom. **mass number (A) = number of protons (***Z* **)** $$\\begin{array}{c} \\text{+ number of} \\\\ \\text{neurons (n)} \\end{array} \\qquad (2.4)$$ #### **2.2.4 Isobars and Isotopes** The composition of any atom can be represented by using the normal element symbol (X) with super-script on the left hand side as the atomic mass number (A) and subscript (*Z*) on the left hand side as the atomic number (i.e., A <sup>Z<\/sup> X). Isobars are the atoms with same mass number but different atomic number for example, 6 14C and 7 14N. On the other hand, atoms with identical atomic number but different atomic mass number are known as **Isotopes**. In other words (according to equation 2.4), it is evident that difference between the isotopes is due to the presence of different number of neutrons present in the nucleus. For example, considering of hydrogen atom again, 99.985% of hydrogen atoms contain only one proton. This isotope is called **protium (1 1H)**. Rest of the percentage of hydrogen atom contains two other isotopes, the one containing 1 proton and 1 neutron is called **deuterium** ( **1 2D**, 0.015%) and the other one possessing 1 proton and 2 neutrons is called **tritium ( 1 3T )**. The latter isotope is found in trace amounts on the earth. Other examples of commonly occuring isotopes are: carbon atoms containing 6, 7 and 8 neutrons besides 6 protons ( <sup>6<\/sup> 12 6 13 6 <sup>14<\/sup> C, C, C ); chlorine atoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons besides 17 protons ( <sup>17<\/sup> 35 17 <sup>37<\/sup> Cl, Cl ). Lastly an important point to mention regarding isotopes is that *chemical properties of atoms are controlled by the number of electrons, which are determined by the number of protons in the nucleus.* Number of neutrons present in the nucleus have very little effect on the chemical properties of an element. Therefore, all the isotopes of a given element show same chemical behaviour.

According to them, the continued subdivisions of matter would ultimately yield atoms which would not be further divisible. The word 'atom' has been derived from the Greek word *'a-tomio'* which means 'uncut-able' or 'non-divisible'. These earlier ideas were mere speculations and there was no way to test them experimentally. These ideas remained dormant for a very long time and were revived again by scientists in the nineteenth century. The atomic theory of matter was first proposed on a firm scientific basis by John Dalton, a British school teacher in 1808. His theory, called **Dalton's atomic theory**, regarded the atom as the ultimate particle of matter (Unit 1). Dalton's atomic theory was able to explain the law of conservation of mass, law of constant composition and law of multiple proportion very successfully. However, it failed to explain the results of many experiments, for example, it was known that substances like glass or ebonite when rubbed with silk or fur get electrically charged. In this unit we start with the experimental observations made by scientists towards the end of nineteenth and beginning of twentieth century. These established that atoms are made of sub-atomic particles, i.e., electrons, protons and neutrons \u2014 a concept very different from that of Dalton.

When classical mechanics\\* is applied to the solar system, it shows that the planets describe well-defined orbits around the sun. The gravitational force between the planets is given by the expression G. 1 2 2 *m m r* where *m*1 and *m*2 are the masses, *r* is the distance of separation of the masses and G is the gravitational constant. The theory can also calculate precisely the planetary orbits and these are in agreement with the experimental measurements. The similarity between the solar system and nuclear model suggests that electrons should move around the nucleus in well defined orbits. Further, the coulomb force (k*q*1*q*2\/*r*2 where *q*1 and *q*2 are the charges, *r* is the distance of separation of the charges and k is the proportionality constant) between electron and the nucleus is mathematically similar to the gravitational force. However, when a body is moving in an orbit, it undergoes acceleration even if it is moving with a constant speed in an orbit because of changing direction. So an electron in the nuclear model describing planet like orbits is under acceleration. According to the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell, charged particles when accelerated should emit electromagnetic radiation (This feature does not exist for planets since they are uncharged). Therefore, an electron in an orbit will emit radiation, the energy carried by radiation comes from electronic motion. The orbit will thus continue to shrink. Calculations show that it should take an electron only 10\u20138 s to spiral into the nucleus. But this does not happen. Thus, the Rutherford model cannot explain the stability of an atom. If the motion of an electron is described on the basis of the classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory, you may ask that since the motion of electrons in orbits is leading to the instability of the atom, then why not consider electrons as stationary Unit 2.indd 36 9\/9\/2022 4:28:09 PM *<sup>\\*<\/sup> Classical mechanics is a theoretical science based on Newton's laws of motion.

            "2.3 Developments Leading to the Bohr's Model of Atom** Historically, results observed from the studies of interactions of radiations with matter have provided immense information regarding the structure of atoms and molecules. Neils Bohr utilised these results to improve upon the model proposed by Rutherford. Two developments played a major role in the formulation of Bohr's model of atom. These were: - (i) Dual character of the electromagnetic radiation which means that radiations possess both wave like and particle like properties, and - (ii) Experimental results regarding atomic spectra. First, we will discuss about the duel nature of electromagnetic radiations. Experimental results regarding atomic spectra will be discussed in Section 2.4. ## **2.3.1 Wave Nature of Electromagnetic Radiation** In the mid-nineteenth century, physicists actively studied absorption and emission of radiation by heated objects. These are called thermal radiations. They tried to find out of what the thermal radiation is made. It is now a well-known fact that thermal radiations consist of electromagnetic waves of various frequencies or wavelengths. It is based on a number of modern concepts, which were unknown in the mid-nineteenth century. First active study of thermal radiation laws occured in the 1850's and the theory of electromagnetic waves and the emission of such waves by accelerating charged particles was developed in the early 1870's by James Clerk Maxwell, which was experimentally confirmed later by Heinrich Hertz. Here, we will learn some facts about electromagnetic radiations. James Maxwell (1870) was the first to give a comprehensive explanation about the interaction between the charged bodies and the behaviour of electrical and magnetic fields on macroscopic level. He suggested that when electrically charged particle moves under accelaration, alternating electrical and magnetic fields are produced and transmitted. These fields are transmitted in the forms of waves called **electromagnetic waves** or **electromagnetic radiation**. Light is the form of radiation known from early days and speculation about its nature dates back to remote ancient times. In earlier days (Newton) light was supposed to be made of particles (corpuscules). It was only in the 19th century when wave nature of light was established. Maxwell was again the first to reveal that light waves are associated with oscillating electric and magnetic character (Fig. 2.6). ![](_page_8_Figure_14.jpeg) *Fig.2.6 The electric and magnetic field components of an electromagnetic wave. These components have the same wavelength, frequency, speed and amplitude, but they vibrate in two mutually perpendicular planes.* Although electromagnetic wave motion is complex in nature, we will consider here only a few simple properties. (i) The oscillating electric and magnetic fields produced by oscillating charged Unit 2.indd 37 9\/9\/2022 4:28:10 PM particles are perpendicular to each other and both are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. Simplified picture of electromagnetic wave is shown in Fig. 2.6. - (ii) Unlike sound waves or waves produced in water, electromagnetic waves do not require medium and can move in vacuum. - (iii) It is now well established that there are many types of electromagnetic radiations, which differ from one another in wavelength (or frequency). These constitute what is called **electromagnetic spectrum** (Fig. 2.7). Different regions of the spectrum are identified by different names. Some examples are: radio frequency region around 106 Hz, used for broadcasting; microwave region around 1010 Hz used for radar; infrared region around 1013 Hz used for heating; ultraviolet region around 1016Hz a component of sun's radiation. The small portion around 1015 Hz, is what is ordinarily called **visible light**. It is only this part which our eyes can see (or detect). Special instruments are required to detect non-visible radiation. (iv) Different kinds of units are used to represent electromagnetic radiation. These radiations are characterised by the properties, namely, frequency (\u03bd) and wavelength (\u03bb). The SI unit for frequency (\u03bd) is hertz (Hz, s\u20131), after Heinrich Hertz. It is defined as the number of waves that pass a given point in one second. Wavelength should have the units of length and as you know that the SI units of length is meter (m). Since electromagnetic radiation consists of different kinds of waves of much smaller wavelengths, smaller units are used. Fig. 2.7 shows various types of electro-magnetic radiations which differ from one another in wavelengths and frequencies. In vaccum all types of electromagnetic radiations, regardless of wavelength, travel at the same speed, i.e., 3.0 \u00d7 108 m s\u20131 (2.997925 \u00d7 108 ms\u20131, to be precise). This is called **speed of light** and is given the symbol 'c'. The frequency (\u03bd ), wavelength (\u03bb) and velocity of light (c) are related by the equation (2.5). $$\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}\\tag{2.5}$$ ![](_page_9_Figure_10.jpeg) *Fig. 2.7 (a) The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. (b) Visible spectrum. The visible region is only a small part of the entire spectrum.* Unit 2.indd 38 9\/9\/2022 4:28:10 PM The other commonly used quantity specially in spectroscopy, is the **wavenumber** ( ). *It is defined as the number of wavelengths per unit length.* Its units are reciprocal of wavelength unit, i.e., m\u20131.

However, following are some of the observations which could not be explained with the help of even the electromagentic theory of 19th century physics (known as classical physics): - (i) the nature of emission of radiation from hot bodies (black-body radiation) - (ii) ejection of electrons from metal surface when radiation strikes it (photoelectric effect) - (iii) variation of heat capacity of solids as a function of temperature Unit 2.indd 39 9\/9\/2022 4:28:10 PM *<sup>\\*<\/sup> Diffraction is the bending of wave around an obstacle.* *<sup>\\*\\*<\/sup> Interference is the combination of two waves of the same or different frequencies to give a wave whose distribution at each point in space is the algebraic or vector sum of disturbances at that point resulting from each interfering wave.* (iv) Line spectra of atoms with special reference to hydrogen. These phenomena indicate that the system can take energy only in discrete amounts. All possible energies cannot be taken up or radiated. It is noteworthy that the first concrete explanation for the phenomenon of the black body radiation mentioned above was given by Max Planck in 1900. Let us first try to understand this phenomenon, which is given below: Hot objects emit electromagnetic radiations over a wide range of wavelengths. At high temperatures, an appreciable proportion of radiation is in the visible region of the spectrum. As the temperature is raised, a higher proportion of short wavelength (blue light) is generated. For example, when an iron rod is heated in a furnace, it first turns to dull red and then progressively becomes more and more red as the temperature increases. As this is heated further, the radiation emitted becomes white and then becomes blue as the temperature becomes very high. This means that red radiation is most intense at a particular temperature and the blue radiation is more intense at another temperature. This means intensities of radiations of different wavelengths emitted by hot body depend upon its temperature. By late 1850's it was known that objects made of different material and kept at different temperatures emit different amount of radiation. Also, when the surface of an object is irradiated with light (electromagnetic radiation), a part of radiant energy is generally reflected as such, a part is absorbed and a part of it is transmitted. The reason for incomplete absorption is that ordinary objects are as a rule imperfect absorbers of radiation. *An ideal body, which emits and absorbs radiations of all frequencies uniformly, is called a black body and the radiation emitted by such a body is called black body radiation.* In practice, no such body exists. Carbon black approximates fairly closely to black body. A good physical approximation to a black body is a cavity with a tiny hole, which has no other opening. Any ray entering the hole will be reflected by the cavity walls and will be eventually absorbed by the walls. A black body is also a perfect radiator of radiant energy. Furthermore, a black body is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. It radiates same amount of energy per unit area as it absorbs from its surrounding in any given time. The amount of light emitted (intensity of radiation) from a black body and its spectral distribution depends only on its temperature. At a given temperature, intensity of radiation emitted increases with the increase of wavelength, reaches a maximum value at a given wavelength and then starts decreasing with further increase of wavelength, as shown in Fig. 2.8. Also, as the temperature increases, maxima of the curve shifts to short wavelength. Several attempts were made to predict the intensity of radiation as a function of wavelength. But the results of the above experiment could not be explained satisfactorily on the basis of the wave theory of light. Max Planck arrived at a satisfactory relationship ![](_page_11_Figure_7.jpeg) *Fig. 2.8 Wavelength-intensity relationship* ![](_page_11_Figure_9.jpeg) *Fig. 2.8(a) Black body* Unit 2.indd 40 9\/9\/2022 4:28:10 PM #### structure of atom 41 by making an assumption that absorption and emmission of radiation arises from oscillator i.e., atoms in the wall of black body. Their frequency of oscillation is changed by interaction with oscilators of electromagnetic radiation. Planck assumed that radiation could be sub-divided into discrete chunks of energy. He suggested that atoms and molecules could emit or absorb energy only in discrete quantities and not in a continuous manner. He gave the name **quantum** to the smallest quantity of energy that can be emitted or absorbed in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The energy (*E*) of a quantum of radiation is proportional to its frequency (\u03bd) and is expressed by equation (2.6). $$E = h\\omega \\tag{2.6}$$ The proportionality constant, '*h*' is known as Planck's constant and has the value 6.626\u00d710\u201334 J s. With this theory, Planck was able to explain the distribution of intensity in the radiation from black body as a function of frequency or wavelength at different temperatures.

Planck also made significant contributions in thermodynamics and other areas of physics.* #### *Photoelectric Effect* In 1887, H. Hertz performed a very interesting experiment in which electrons (or electric current) were ejected when certain metals (for example potassium, rubidium, caesium etc.) were exposed to a beam of light as shown in Fig. 2.9. The phenomenon is called **Photoelectric effect**. The results observed in this experiment were: - (i) The electrons are ejected from the metal surface as soon as the beam of light strikes the surface, i.e., there is no time lag between the striking of light beam and the ejection of electrons from the metal surface. - (ii) The number of electrons ejected is proportional to the intensity or brightness of light. - (iii) For each metal, there is a characteristic minimum frequency, \u03bd0 (also known as **threshold frequency**) below which photoelectric effect is not observed. At a frequency \u03bd >\u03bd0, the ejected electrons come out with certain kinetic energy. The kinetic energies of these electrons increase with the increase of frequency of the light used. All the above results could not be explained on the basis of laws of classical physics. According to latter, the energy content of the beam of light depends upon the brightness of the light. In other words, number of electrons ejected and kinetic energy associated with them should depend on the brightness of light. It has been observed that though the number Unit 2.indd 41 9\/9\/2022 4:28:11 PM **Table 2.2 Values of Work Function (W0) for a Few Metals** | Metal | Li | Na | K | Mg | Cu | Ag | |--------|------|-----|------|-----|-----|-----| | W0 \/eV | 2.42 | 2.3 | 2.25 | 3.7 | 4.8 | 4.3 | of electrons ejected does depend upon the brightness of light, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons does not. For example, red light [\u03bd = (4.3 to 4.6) \u00d7 1014 Hz] of any brightness (intensity) may shine on a piece of potassium metal for hours but no photoelectrons are ejected. But, as soon as even a very weak yellow light (\u03bd = 5.1\u20135.2 \u00d7 1014 Hz) shines on the potassium metal, the photoelectric effect is observed. The threshold frequency (\u03bd0) for potassium metal is 5.0\u00d71014 Hz. Einstein (1905) was able to explain the photoelectric effect using Planck's quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation as a starting point. *Albert Einstein, a German born American physicist, is regarded by many as one of the two great physicists the world has known (the other is Isaac Newton). His three research papers (on special relativity, Brownian motion and the photoelectric effect) which he published in 1905, while he* ![](_page_13_Picture_6.jpeg) **Albert Einstein (1879\u20131955)** *was employed as a technical assistant in a Swiss patent office in Berne have profoundly influenced the development of physics. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.* Shining a beam of light on to a metal surface can, therefore, be viewed as shooting a beam of particles, the photons. When a photon of sufficient energy strikes an electron in the atom of the metal, it transfers its energy instantaneously to the electron during the collision and the electron is ejected without any time lag or delay. Greater the energy possessed by the photon, greater will be transfer of energy to the electron and greater the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. In other words, kinetic energy of the ejected electron is proportional to the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation. Since the striking photon has energy equal to *h*\u03bd and the minimum energy required to eject the electron is *h*\u03bd0 (also called work function, W0; Table 2.2), then the difference in energy (*h*\u03bd \u2013 *h*\u03bd0 ) is transferred as the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. Following the conservation of energy principle, the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is given by the equation 2.7. $$ \\hbar \\nu = \\hbar \\nu\\_0 + \\frac{1}{2} m\\_e \\mathbf{v}^2 \\tag{2.7} $$ where *m*<sup>e<\/sup> is the mass of the electron and *v* is the velocity associated with the ejected electron. Lastly, a more intense beam of light consists of larger number of photons, consequently the number of electrons ejected is also larger as compared to that in an experiment in which a beam of weaker intensity of light is employed. ## *Dual Behaviour of Electromagnetic Radiation* The particle nature of light posed a dilemma for scientists. On the one hand, it could explain the black body radiation and photoelectric effect satisfactorily but on the other hand, it was not consistent with the known wave behaviour of light which could account for the phenomena of interference and diffraction. The only way to resolve the dilemma was to accept the idea that light possesses both particle and wave-like properties, i.e., light has dual behaviour. Depending on the experiment, we find that light behaves either as a wave or as a stream of particles. Whenever radiation interacts with matter, it displays particle like properties in contrast to the wavelike properties (interference and diffraction), which it exhibits when it propagates. This concept was totally alien to the way the scientists thought about matter and radiation and it took them a long time to become convinced of its validity. It turns out, as you shall see later, that some microscopic particles like electrons also exhibit this waveparticle duality. Unit 2.indd 42 9\/9\/2022 4:28:11 PM ##"

As a result, the beam of light is deviated or refracted from its original path as it passes from one medium to another. It is observed that when a ray of white light is passed through a prism, the wave with shorter wavelength bends more than the one with a longer wavelength. Since ordinary white light consists of waves with all the wavelengths in the visible range, a ray of white light is spread out into a series of coloured bands called **spectrum**. The light of red colour which has longest wavelength is deviated the least while the violet light, which has shortest wavelength is deviated the most. The spectrum of white light, that we can see, ranges from violet at 7.50 \u00d7 1014 Hz to red at 4\u00d71014 Hz. Such a spectrum is called **continuous spectrum.** Continuous because violet merges into blue, blue into green and so on. A similar spectrum is produced when a rainbow forms in the sky. Remember that visible light is just a small portion of the electromagnetic radiation (Fig.2.7). When electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter, atoms and molecules may absorb energy and reach to a higher energy state. With higher energy, these are in an unstable state. For returning to their normal (more stable, lower energy states) energy state, the atoms and molecules emit radiations in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. ## *Emission and Absorption Spectra* The spectrum of radiation emitted by a substance that has absorbed energy is called an **emission spectrum**. Atoms, molecules or ions that have absorbed radiation are said to be **\"excited\"**. To produce an emission spectrum, energy is supplied to a sample by heating it or irradiating it and the wavelength (or frequency) of the radiation emitted, as the sample gives up the absorbed energy, is recorded. An absorption spectrum is like the photographic negative of an emission spectrum. A continuum of radiation is passed through a sample which absorbs radiation of certain wavelengths. The missing wavelength which corresponds to the radiation absorbed by the matter, leave dark spaces in the bright continuous spectrum. The study of emission or absorption spectra is referred to as **spectroscopy**. The spectrum of the visible light, as discussed above, was continuous as all wavelengths (red to violet) of the visible light are represented in the spectra. The emission spectra of atoms in the gas phase, on the other hand, do not show a continuous spread of wavelength from red to violet, rather they emit light only at specific wavelengths with dark spaces between them. Such spectra are called **line spectra** or **atomic spectra** because the emitted radiation is identified by the appearance of bright lines in the spectra (Fig. 2.10 page 45). **Line emission spectra** are of great interest in the study of electronic structure. Each element has a unique line emission spectrum. The characteristic lines in atomic spectra can be used in chemical analysis to identify"

The exact matching of lines of the emission spectrum of the atoms of a known element with the lines from an unknown sample quickly establishes the identity of the latter, German chemist, Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) was one of the first investigators to use line spectra to identify elements. Elements like rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs) thallium (Tl), indium (In), gallium (Ga) and scandium (Sc) were discovered when their minerals were analysed by spectroscopic methods. The element helium (He) was discovered in the sun by spectroscopic method. # *Line Spectrum of Hydrogen* When an electric discharge is passed through gaseous hydrogen, the H2 molecules dissociate and the energetically excited hydrogen atoms produced emit electromagnetic radiation of *discrete frequencies*. The hydrogen spectrum consists of several series of *lines* named after their discoverers.

Thus an emission spectrum, which is a photographic recording of the separated wavelengths is called as line spectrum. Any sample of reasonable size contains an enormous number of atoms. Although a single atom can be in only one excited state at a time, the collection of atoms contains all possible excited states. The light emitted as these atoms fall to lower energy states is responsible for the spectrum. (b) Atomic absorption.

The Balmer series of lines are the only lines in the hydrogen spectrum which appear in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Swedish spectroscopist, Johannes Rydberg, noted that all series of lines in the hydrogen spectrum could be described by the following expression : $$\\overline{N} = 109,677 \\left( \\frac{\\overline{1}}{n\\_1^2} - \\frac{1}{n\\_2^2} \\right) \\text{ cm}^{-1} \\tag{2.9}$$ where *n*1=1,2........ $$n\\_2 = n\\_1 + 1, \\; n\\_1 + 2, \\dots, 1$$ The value 109,677 cm\u20131 is called the **Rydberg constant** for hydrogen.

            "2.4 Bohr's Model for Hydrogen Atom** Neils Bohr (1913) was the first to explain quantitatively the general features of the structure of hydrogen atom and its spectrum. He used Planck's concept of quantisation of energy. Though the theory is not the modern quantum mechanics, it can still be used to rationalize many points in the atomic structure and spectra. Bohr's model for hydrogen atom is based on the following postulates: - i) The electron in the hydrogen atom can move around the nucleus in a circular path of fixed radius and energy. These paths are called **orbits**, stationary states or allowed energy states. These orbits are arranged concentrically around the nucleus. - ii) The energy of an electron in the orbit does not change with time. However, the electron will move from a lower stationary state to a higher stationary state when required amount of energy is absorbed by the electron or energy is emitted when electron moves from higher stationary state to lower stationary state (equation 2.16). The energy change does not take place in a continuous manner. #### **Angular Momentum** Just as linear momentum is the product of mass (*m*) and linear velocity (v), angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia (*I*) and angular velocity (\u03c9). For an electron of mass *m*<sup>e<\/sup> , moving in a circular path of radius *r* around the nucleus, angular momentum = *I* \u00d7 \u03c9 Since *I* = *m*<sup>e<\/sup> r2, and \u03c9 = v\/*r* where v is the linear velocity, \u2234angular momentum = *m*<sup>e<\/sup> *r*<sup>2<\/sup> \u00d7 v\/*r* = *m*<sup>e<\/sup> v*r* iii) The frequency of radiation absorbed or emitted when transition occurs between two stationary states that differ in energy by \u2206*E*, is given by: $$m = \\frac{\\Delta E}{h} = \\frac{E\\_2 - E\\_1}{h} \\tag{2.10}$$ Where *E*1 and *E*2 are the energies of the lower and higher allowed energy states respectively. This expression is commonly known as Bohr's frequency rule. iv) The angular momentum of an electron is quantised. In a given stationary state it can be expressed as in equation (2.11) $$m\\_e \\le r = n. \\frac{h}{2\\pi} \\quad n = 1, 2, 3... \\qquad \\text{(2.11)}$$ Unit 2.indd 46 9\/9\/2022 4:28:13 PM #### structure of atom 47 Where *m*e is the mass of electron, *v* is the velocity and *r* is the radius of the orbit in which electron is moving. Thus an electron can move only in those orbits for which its angular momentum is integral multiple of *h*\/2\u03c0. That means angular momentum is quantised. Radiation is emitted or obsorbed only when transition of electron takes place from one quantised value of angular momentum to another. Therefore, Maxwell's electromagnetic theory does not apply here that is why only certain fixed orbits are allowed. The details regarding the derivation of energies of the stationary states used by Bohr, are quite complicated and will be discussed in higher classes. However, according to Bohr's theory for hydrogen atom: - a) The stationary states for electron are numbered *n* = 1,2,3.......... These integral numbers (Section 2.6.2) are known as **Principal quantum numbers**. - b) The radii of the stationary states are expressed as: $$r\\_{\\mathbf{n}} = n^2 \\, a\\_{\\mathbf{0}} \\, \\tag{2.12}$$ where *a*0 = 52.9 pm. Thus the radius of the first stationary state, called the **Bohr orbit**, is 52.9 pm. Normally the electron in the hydrogen atom is found in this orbit (that is *n*=1). As *n* increases the value of *r* will increase. In other words the electron will be present away from the nucleus. c) The most important property associated with the electron, is the energy of its stationary state. It is given by the expression. $$E\\_n = -\\mathcal{R}\\_H \\left(\\frac{1}{n^2}\\right) \\qquad \\Bigvee\\Big.\\tag{2.13}$$ where RH is called **Rydberg constant** and its value is 2.18\u00d710\u201318 J.

He then spent a year* *with J.J. Thomson and Ernest* *Rutherford in England. In 1913, he returned to Copenhagen where he remained for the rest of his life. In 1920 he was named Director of the Institute of theoretical Physics. After first World War, Bohr worked energetically for peaceful uses of atomic energy. He received the first Atoms for Peace award in 1957. Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922.* *Niels Bohr* Fig. 2.11 depicts the energies of different stationary states or energy levels of hydrogen atom. This representation is called an energy level diagram. When the electron is free from the influence of nucleus, the energy is taken as zero. The electron in this situation is associated with the stationary state of Principal Quantum number = *n* = \u221e and is called as ionized hydrogen atom. When the electron is attracted by the nucleus and is present in orbit n, the energy is emitted and its energy is lowered. That is the reason ## **What does the negative electronic energy (***En***) for hydrogen atom mean?** The energy of the electron in a hydrogen atom has a negative sign for all possible orbits (eq. 2.13). What does this negative sign convey? This negative sign means that the energy of the electron in the atom is lower than the energy of a free electron at rest. A free electron at rest is an electron that is infinitely far away from the nucleus and is assigned the energy value of zero. Mathematically, this corresponds to setting n equal to infinity in the equation (2.13) so that *E*\u221e=0. As the electron gets closer to the nucleus (as *n* decreases), *En* becomes larger in absolute value and more and more negative. The most negative energy value is given by *n*=1 which corresponds to the most stable"

For example, He+ Li2+, Be3+ and so on. The energies of the stationary states associated with these kinds of ions (also known as hydrogen like species) are given by the expression. $$E\\_n = -2.18 \\times 10^{-18} \\left(\\frac{Z^2}{n^2}\\right) \\text{J} \\tag{2.14}$$ and radii by the expression $$\\mathbf{r}\\_{\\mathrm{n}} = \\frac{52.9 \\,\\mathrm{(n^2)}}{Z} \\,\\mathrm{pm} \\tag{2.15}$$ where *Z* is the atomic number and has values 2,3 for the helium and lithium atoms respectively. From the above equations, it is evident that the value of energy becomes more negative and that of radius becomes smaller with increase of *Z*. This means that electron will be tightly bound to the nucleus. e) It is also possible to calculate the velocities of electrons moving in these orbits. Although the precise equation is not given here, qualitatively the magnitude of velocity of electron increases with increase of positive charge on the nucleus and decreases with increase of principal quantum number. ## **2.4.1 Explanation of Line Spectrum of Hydrogen** Line spectrum observed in case of hydrogen atom, as mentioned in section 2.3.3, can be explained quantitatively using Bohr's model. According to assumption 2, radiation (energy) is absorbed if the electron moves from the orbit of smaller Principal quantum number to the orbit of higher Principal quantum number, whereas the radiation (energy) is emitted if the electron moves from higher orbit to lower orbit. The energy gap between the two orbits is given by equation (2.16) $$ \\Delta E = E\\_\\text{f} - E\\_\\text{i} \\tag{2.16} $$ Combining equations (2.13) and (2.16) $$\\Delta E = \\left(-\\frac{\\mathcal{R}\\_{\\rm H}}{n\\_{\\rm f}^2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\mathcal{R}\\_{\\rm H}}{n\\_{\\rm i}^2}\\right) \\text{ (where } n\\_{\\rm i} \\text{ and } n\\_{\\rm f} \\text{)}$$ stand for initial orbit and final orbits) $$ \\Delta E = \\mathbf{R\\_{H}} \\left( \\frac{1}{n\\_{\\text{i}}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n\\_{\\text{f}}^{2}} \\right) = 2.18 \\times 1 \\,\\mathrm{O}^{-18} \\,\\mathrm{J} \\left( \\frac{1}{n\\_{\\text{i}}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n\\_{\\text{f}}^{2}} \\right) $$ (2.17) The frequency (\u03bd) associated with the absorption and emission of the photon can be evaluated by using equation (2.18) $$\\begin{split} \\mathbf{v} &= \\frac{\\Delta E}{h} = \\frac{\\mathbf{R}\\_{\\text{H}}}{h} \\left( \\frac{1}{n\\_{\\text{1}}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n\\_{\\text{f}}^{2}} \\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{2.18 \\times 10^{-18} \\,\\text{J}}{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\,\\text{J} \\,\\text{s}} \\left( \\frac{1}{n\\_{\\text{1}}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n\\_{\\text{f}}^{2}} \\right) \\end{split} \\tag{2.18}$$ $$= 3.29 \\times 10^{15} \\left( \\frac{1}{n\\_1^2} - \\frac{1}{n\\_1^2} \\right) \\text{Hz} \\tag{2.19}$$ and in terms of wavenumbers ( ) $$\\frac{\\nu}{V} = \\frac{\\nu}{c} = \\frac{\\mathbf{R\\_H}}{hc} \\left( \\frac{1}{n\\_\\mathrm{i}^2} - \\frac{1}{n\\_\\mathrm{f}^2} \\right) \\tag{2.20}$$ $$= \\frac{3.29 \\times 10^{15} \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{3 \\times 10^8 \\,\\mathrm{m} \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-\\*}} \\left( \\frac{1}{n\\_\\mathrm{i}^2} - \\frac{1}{n\\_\\mathrm{f}^2} \\right)$$ $$= \\frac{1}{(1 - 1)}$$ $$= 1.09677 \\times 10^7 \\left( \\frac{1}{n\\_{\\text{i}}^2} - \\frac{1}{n\\_{\\text{f}}^2} \\right) \\text{m}^{-1} \\tag{2.21}$$ In case of absorption spectrum, *n*f > *n*<sup>i<\/sup> and the term in the parenthesis is positive and energy is absorbed. On the other hand in case of emission spectrum *n*i > *n*f , \u2206 *E* is negative and energy is released. The expression (2.17) is similar to that used by Rydberg (2.9) derived empirically using the experimental data available at that time. Further, each spectral line, whether in absorption or emission spectrum, can be associated to the particular transition in hydrogen atom. In case of large number of hydrogen atoms, different possible transitions can be observed and thus leading to large number of spectral lines.

However, Bohr's model was too simple to account for the following points. - i) It fails to account for the finer details (doublet, that is two closely spaced lines) of the hydrogen atom spectrum observed by using sophisticated spectroscopic techniques. This model is also unable to explain the spectrum of atoms other than hydrogen, for example, helium atom which possesses only two electrons. Further, Bohr's theory was also unable to explain the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of magnetic field (Zeeman effect) or an electric field (Stark effect). - ii) It could not explain the ability of atoms to form molecules by chemical bonds.

            "2.5 Towards Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom** In view of the shortcoming of the Bohr's model, attempts were made to develop a more suitable and general model for atoms. Two important developments which contributed significantly in the formulation of such a model were: - 1. Dual behaviour of matter, - 2. Heisenberg uncertainty principle. ## **2.5.1 Dual Behaviour of Matter** The French physicist, de Broglie, in 1924 proposed that matter, like radiation, should also exhibit dual behaviour i.e., both particle and wavelike properties. This means that just as the photon has momentum as well as wavelength, electrons should also have momentum as well as wavelength, de Broglie, from this analogy, gave the following relation between wavelength (\u03bb) and momentum (p) of a material particle. Unit 2.indd 49 9\/9\/2022 4:28:15 PM #### *Louis de Broglie (1892\u20131987)* *Louis de Broglie, a French physicist, studied history as an undergraduate in the early 1910's. His interest turned to science as a result of his assignment to radio communications in World War I. He received his* ![](_page_21_Picture_3.jpeg) *Dr. Sc. from the University of Paris in 1924. He was professor of theoretical physics at the University of Paris from 1932 untill his retirement in 1962. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929.* $$ \\lambda = \\frac{h}{m\\mathbf{v}} = \\frac{h}{p} \\tag{2.22} $$ where *m* is the mass of the particle, v its velocity and *p* its momentum. de Broglie's prediction was confirmed experimentally when it was found that an electron beam undergoes diffraction, a phenomenon characteristic of waves. This fact has been put to use in making an electron microscope, which is based on the wavelike behaviour of electrons just as an ordinary microscope utilises the wave nature of light. An electron microscope is a powerful tool in modern scientific research because it achieves a magnification of about 15 million times. It needs to be noted that according to de Broglie, every object in motion has a wave character. The wavelengths associated with ordinary objects are so short (because of their large masses) that their wave properties cannot be detected. The wavelengths associated with electrons and other subatomic particles (with very small mass) can however be detected experimentally. Results obtained from the following problems prove these points qualitatively. # **Problem 2.12** What will be the wavelength of a ball of mass 0.1 kg moving with a velocity of 10 m s\u20131 ? # **Solution** According to de Brogile equation (2.22) $$\\lambda = \\frac{h}{m\\text{v}} = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{Js})}{(0.1 \\text{ kg})(10 \\text{ m s}^{-1})}$$ $$= 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\,\\mathrm{m} \\text{ (J = kg } \\mathrm{m^2 } \\mathrm{s^{-2}})$$ #### **Problem 2.13** The mass of an electron is 9.1\u00d710\u201331 kg.

Unit 2.indd 50 9\/9\/2022 4:28:16 PM $$ \\Delta \\mathbf{x} \\times \\Delta p\\_{\\times} \\ge \\frac{h}{4\\pi} \\tag{2.23} $$ $$ \\text{or } \\Delta \\mathbf{x} \\times \\Delta \\{ m \\mathbf{w}\\_{\\times} \\} \\ge \\frac{h}{4\\pi} $$ $$ \\text{or } \\Delta \\mathbf{x} \\times \\Delta \\mathbf{v}\\_{\\times} \\ge \\frac{h}{4\\pi m} $$ where \u2206x is the uncertainty in position and \u2206*px* (or \u2206vx) is the uncertainty in momentum (or velocity) of the particle. If the position of the electron is known with high degree of accuracy (\u2206x is small), then the velocity of the electron will be uncertain [\u2206(vx ) is large]. On the other hand, if the velocity of the electron is known precisely (\u2206(v*x* ) is small), then the position of the electron will be uncertain (\u2206x will be large). Thus, if we carry out some physical measurements on the electron's position or velocity, the outcome will always depict a fuzzy or blur picture. The uncertainty principle can be best understood with the help of an example. Suppose you are asked to measure the thickness of a sheet of paper with an unmarked metrestick. Obviously, the results obtained would be extremely inaccurate and meaningless. In order to obtain any accuracy, you should use an instrument graduated in units smaller than the thickness of a sheet of the paper. Analogously, in order to determine the position of an electron, we must use a meterstick calibrated in units of smaller than the dimensions of electron (keep in mind that an electron is considered as a point charge and is therefore, dimensionless). To observe an electron, we can illuminate it with \"light\" or electromagnetic radiation. The \"light\" used must have a wavelength smaller than the dimensions of an electron. The high momentum photons of such light *p h*= would change the energy of electrons by collisions. In this process we, no doubt, would be able to calculate the position of the electron, but we would know very little about the velocity of the electron after the collision. #### *Significance of Uncertainty Principle* One of the important implications of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is that **it rules out existence of definite paths or trajectories of electrons and other similar particles.** The trajectory of an object is determined by its location and velocity at various moments.

            "we also know its velocity and the forces acting on it at that instant, we can tell where the body would be sometime later. We, therefore, conclude that the position of an object and its velocity fix its trajectory. Since for a sub-atomic object such as an electron, it is not possible simultaneously to determine the position and velocity at any given instant to an arbitrary degree of precision, it is not possible to talk of the trajectory of an electron. **The effect of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is significant only for motion of microscopic objects and is negligible for that of macroscopic objects.** This can be seen from the following examples. If uncertainty principle is applied to an object of mass, say about a milligram (10\u20136 kg), then $$\\begin{aligned} \\text{Av.} \\Delta \\mathbf{x} &= \\frac{n}{4\\pi.m} \\\\ &= \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{s}}{4 \\times 3.1416 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{kg}} \\approx 10^{-28} \\mathrm{m}^2 \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\end{aligned}$$ *Werner Heisenberg (1901\u20131976) Werner Heisenberg (1901\u20131976) received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Munich in 1923.

He was also accomplished mountain climber.

Therefore, one may say that **in dealing with milligramsized or heavier objects, the associated uncertainties are hardly of any real consequence.** In the case of a microscopic object like an electron on the other hand. \u2206v.\u2206x obtained is much larger and such uncertainties are of real consequence. For example, for an electron whose mass is 9.11\u00d710\u201331 kg., according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle $$\\begin{aligned} \\Delta \\mathbf{v}. \\Delta \\mathbf{x} &= \\frac{h}{4\\pi m} \\\\ &= \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ Js}}{4 \\times 3.1416 \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg}} \\\\ &= 10^{-4} \\text{m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1} \\end{aligned}$$ It, therefore, means that if one tries to find the exact location of the electron, say to an uncertainty of only 10\u20138 m, then the uncertainty \u2206v in velocity would be $$\\frac{10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 10^4\\,\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$$ which is so large that the classical picture of electrons moving in Bohr's orbits (fixed) cannot hold good. **It, therefore, means that the precise statements of the position and momentum of electrons have to be replaced by the statements of probability, that the electron has at a given position and momentum. This is what happens in the quantum mechanical model of atom.** ## **Problem 2.15** A microscope using suitable photons is employed to locate an electron in an atom within a distance of 0.1 \u00c5.

If the speed can be measured within accuracy of 2%, calculate the uncertainty in the position. ## **Solution** The uncertainty in the speed is 2%, i.e., $$\\begin{array}{l} \\textbf{45} \\quad \\frac{\\textbf{2}}{\\textbf{100}} = \\textbf{0}.\\textbf{9} \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\\\ \\text{Using the equation (2.22)} \\end{array}$$ $$ \\Delta \\mathbf{x} = \\frac{m}{4\\pi m \\Delta \\mathbf{v}} $$ $$ \\frac{\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{G} 26 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ Js}}{\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{G} 26 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ Js}} $$ = 1.46\u00d710\u201333 m This is nearly ~ 1018 times smaller than the diameter of a typical atomic nucleus. As mentioned earlier for large particles, the uncertainty principle sets no meaningful limit to the precision of measurements. ## *Reasons for the Failure of the Bohr Model* One can now understand the reasons for the failure of the Bohr model. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged particle moving in well defined circular orbits about the nucleus. The wave character of the electron is not considered in Bohr model. Further, an orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can completely be defined only if both the position and the velocity of the electron are known exactly at the same time. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. *Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores dual behaviour of matter but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle*. Unit 2.indd 52 9\/9\/2022 4:28:16 PM *Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, an Austrian physicist received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Vienna in 1910. In 1927 Schr\u00f6dinger succeeded Max Planck at the University of Berlin at Planck's request. In 1933, Schr\u00f6dinger left Berlin because of his opposition to Hitler and Nazi policies and returned* ![](_page_24_Picture_2.jpeg) *Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger (1887\u20131961)* *to Austria in 1936.

In fact an insight into the structure of the atom was needed which could account for wave-particle duality of matter and be consistent with Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This came with the advent of quantum mechanics. ## **2.6 Quantum Mechanical Model of Atom** Classical mechanics, based on Newton's laws of motion, successfully describes the motion of all macroscopic objects such as a falling stone, orbiting planets etc., which have essentially a particle-like behaviour as shown in the previous section.

            "fails when applied to microscopic objects like electrons, atoms, molecules etc. This is mainly because of the fact that classical mechanics ignores the concept of dual behaviour of matter especially for sub-atomic particles and the uncertainty principle. The branch of science that takes into account this dual behaviour of matter is called **quantum mechanics**. Quantum mechanics is a theoretical science that deals with the study of the motions of the microscopic objects that have both observable wave like and particle like properties. It specifies the laws of motion that these objects obey. When quantum mechanics is applied to macroscopic objects (for which wave like properties are insignificant) the results are the same as those from the classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics was developed independently in 1926 by Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger. Here, however, we shall be discussing the quantum mechanics which is based on the ideas of wave motion. The fundamental equation of quantum mechanics was developed by Schr\u00f6dinger and it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933. This equation which incorporates waveparticle duality of matter as proposed by de Broglie is quite complex and knowledge of higher mathematics is needed to solve it. You will learn its solutions for different systems in higher classes. For a system (such as an atom or a molecule whose energy does not change with time) the **Schr\u00f6dinger equation** is written as where is a mathematical operator called Hamiltonian. Schr\u00f6dinger gave a recipe of constructing this operator from the expression for the total energy of the system. The total energy of the system takes into account the kinetic energies of all the sub-atomic particles (electrons, nuclei), attractive potential between the electrons and nuclei and repulsive potential among the electrons and nuclei individually. Solution of this equation gives *E* and \u03c8. ## *Hydrogen Atom and the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation* When Schr\u00f6dinger equation is solved for hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy levels the electron can occupy and the corresponding wave function(s) (\u03c8) of the electron associated with each energy level. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (**principal quantum number** *n***, azimuthal quantum number** *l* **and magnetic quantum number** *ml* ) arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. When an electron is in any energy state, the wave function Unit 2.indd 53 9\/9\/2022 4:28:17 PM corresponding to that energy state contains all information about the electron. The wave function is a mathematical function whose value depends upon the coordinates of the electron in the atom and does not carry any physical meaning. Such wave functions of hydrogen or hydrogen like species with one electron are called **atomic orbitals**. Such wave functions pertaining to one-electron species are called one-electron systems. The probability of finding an electron at a point within an atom is proportional to the |\u03c8|<sup>2<\/sup> at that point. The quantum mechanical results of the hydrogen atom successfully predict all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model. Application of Schr\u00f6dinger equation to multi-electron atoms presents a difficulty: the Schr\u00f6dinger equation cannot be solved exactly for a multi-electron atom. This difficulty can be overcome by using approximate methods. Such calculations with the aid of modern computers show that orbitals in atoms other than hydrogen do not differ in any radical way from the hydrogen orbitals discussed above. The principal difference lies in the consequence of increased nuclear charge. Because of this all the orbitals are somewhat contracted. Further, as you shall see later (in subsections 2.6.3 and 2.6.4), unlike orbitals of hydrogen or hydrogen like species, whose energies depend only on the quantum number *n,* the energies of the orbitals in multi-electron atoms depend on quantum numbers *n* and *l*. ## **Important Features of the Quantum Mechanical Model of Atom** Quantum mechanical model of atom is the picture of the structure of the atom, which emerges from the application of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to atoms. The following are the important features of the quantum-mechanical model of atom: 1. The energy of electrons in atoms is quantized (i.e., can only have certain specific values), for example when electrons are bound to the nucleus in atoms. - 2. The existence of quantised electronic energy levels is a direct result of the wave like properties of electrons and are allowed solutions of Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation. - 3. Both the exact position and exact velocity of an electron in an atom cannot be determined simultaneously (Heisenberg uncertainty principle). The path of an electron in an atom therefore, can never be determined or known accurately. That is why, as you shall see later on, one talks of only probability of finding the electron at different points in an atom. - 4. **An atomic orbital is the wave function** \u03c8 **for an electron in an atom**. Whenever an electron is described by a wave function, we say that the electron occupies that orbital. Since many such wave functions are possible for an electron, there are many atomic orbitals in an atom. These \"one electron orbital wave functions\" or orbitals form the basis of the electronic structure of atoms. In each orbital, the electron has a definite energy. An orbital cannot contain more than two electrons. In a multi-electron atom, the electrons are filled in various orbitals in the order of increasing energy. For each electron of a multi-electron atom, there shall, therefore, be an orbital wave function characteristic of the orbital it occupies. All the information about the electron in an atom is stored in its orbital wave function \u03c8 and quantum mechanics makes it possible to extract this information out of \u03c8. - 5. The probability of finding an electron at a point within an atom is proportional to the square of the orbital wave function i.e., |\u03c8|<sup>2<\/sup> at that point. |\u03c8|<sup>2<\/sup> is known as **probability density** and is always positive. *From the value of* **|**\u03c8**|<sup>2<\/sup>** *at different points within an"

Qualitatively these orbitals can Unit 2.indd 54 9\/9\/2022 4:28:17 PM be distinguished by their size, shape and orientation. An orbital of smaller size means there is more chance of finding the electron near the nucleus. Similarly shape and orientation mean that there is more probability of finding the electron along certain directions than along others. Atomic orbitals are precisely distinguished by what are known as quantum numbers. Each orbital is designated by three quantum numbers labelled as *n, l* and *ml* . **The principal quantum number** '*n*' is a positive integer with value of *n* = 1,2,3....... The principal quantum number determines the *size and to large extent the energy of the orbital.* For hydrogen atom and hydrogen like species (He+, Li2+, .... etc.) energy and size of the orbital depends only on '*n*'. The principal quantum number also identifies the **shell**. With the increase in the value of '*n*', the number of allowed orbital increases and **are given by '***n***2' All the orbitals of a given value of 'n' constitute a single shell of atom** and are represented by the following letters *n* = 1 2 3 4 ............ Shell = K L M N ............ Size of an orbital increases with increase of principal quantum number '*n*'. In other words the electron will be located away from the nucleus. Since energy is required in shifting away the negatively charged electron from the positively charged nucleus, the energy of the orbital will increase with increase of *n*. **Azimuthal quantum number. '***l***'** is also known as **orbital angular momentum or subsidiary quantum number.** It defines the three-dimensional shape of the orbital. For a given value of *n*, *l* can have *n* values ranging from 0 to *n* \u2013 1, that is, for a given value of *n*, the possible value of *l* are : *l* = 0, 1, 2, .......... (*n*\u20131) For example, when *n* = 1, value of *l* is only 0. For *n* = 2, the possible value of *l* can be 0 and 1. For *n* = 3, the possible *l* values are 0, 1 and 2. Each shell consists of one or more **sub-shells** or **sub-levels**. The number of sub-shells in a principal shell is equal to the value of *n*. For example in the first shell (*n* = 1), there is only one sub-shell which corresponds to *l* = 0. There are two sub-shells (*l* = 0, 1) in the second shell (*n* = 2), three (*l* = 0, 1, 2) in third shell (*n* = 3) and so on. Each sub-shell is assigned an azimuthal quantum number (*l*).

Unit 2.indd 55 9\/9\/2022 4:28:17 PM Each orbital in an atom, therefore, is defined by a set of values for *n*, *l* and *ml* .

But all these quantum numbers are not enough to explain the line spectra observed in the case of multi-electron atoms, that is, some of the lines actually occur in doublets (two lines closely spaced), triplets (three lines, closely spaced) etc. This suggests the presence of a few more energy levels than predicted by the three quantum numbers. In 1925, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit proposed the presence of the fourth quantum number known as the **electron spin quantum number (***ms***).** An electron spins around its own axis, much in a similar way as earth spins around its own axis while revolving around the sun.

These two orientations are distinguished by the spin quantum numbers *m*s which can take the values of +\u00bd or \u2013\u00bd. These are called the **two spin states of the electron** and are normally represented by two arrows, \u2191 (spin up) and \u2193 (spin down). Two electrons that have different *m*<sup>s<\/sup> values (one +\u00bd and the other \u2013\u00bd) are said to have opposite spins. An orbital cannot hold more than two electrons and these two electrons should have opposite spins. To sum up, the four quantum numbers provide the following information : - i) *n* defines the shell, determines the size of the orbital and also to a large extent the energy of the orbital. - ii) There are *n* subshells in the *n*th shell. *l* identifies the subshell and determines the shape of the orbital (see section 2.6.2). There are (2*l*+1) orbitals of each type in a subshell, that is, one *s* orbital (*l* = 0), three *p* orbitals (*l* = 1) and five *d* orbitals (*l* = 2) per subshell. To some extent *l* also determines the energy of the orbital in a multi-electron atom. - iii) *ml* designates the orientation of the orbital. For a given value of *l*, *ml* has (2*l*+1) values, the same as the number of orbitals per subshell. It means that #### **Orbit, orbital and its importance** Orbit and orbital are not synonymous. An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path around the nucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the electron is impossible according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore, have no real meaning and their existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An atomic orbital, on the other hand, is a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one electron wave function \u03c8 in an atom. It is characterized by three quantum numbers (*n, l* and *ml* ) and its value depends upon the coordinates of the electron. \u03c8 has, by itself, no physical meaning. It is the square of the wave function i.e., |\u03c8|2 which has a physical meaning. |\u03c8|2 at any point in an atom gives the value of probability density at that point. Probability density (|\u03c8|2) is the probability per unit volume and the product of |\u03c8|2 and a small volume (called a volume element) yields the probability of finding the electron in that volume (the reason for specifying a small volume element is that |\u03c8|2 varies from one region to another in space but its value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element). The total probability of finding the electron in a given volume can then be calculated by the sum of all the products of |\u03c8|2 and the corresponding volume elements. It is thus possible to get the probable distribution of an electron in an orbital. Unit 2.indd 56 9\/9\/2022 4:28:17 PM the number of orbitals is equal to the number of ways in which they are oriented. iv) *m***<sup>s<\/sup>** refers to orientation of the spin of the electron. #### **Problem 2.17** What is the total number of orbitals associated with the principal quantum number *n* = 3 ? #### **Solution** For *n* = 3, the possible values of *l* are 0, 1 and 2. Thus there is one 3*s* orbital (*n* = 3, *l* = 0 and m*<sup>l<\/sup>* = 0); there are three 3*p* orbitals (*n* = 3, *l* = 1 and *ml* = \u20131, 0, +1); there are five 3*d* orbitals (*n* = 3, *l* = 2 and *ml* = \u20132, \u20131, 0, +1+, +2). Therefore, the total number of orbitals is 1+3+5 = 9 The same value can also be obtained by using the relation; number of orbitals = *n*2, i.e. 32 = 9. #### **Problem 2.18** Using *s*, *p*, *d*, f notations, describe the orbital with the following quantum numbers (a) *n* = 2, *l* = 1, (b) *n* = 4, *l* = 0, (c) *n* = 5, *l* = 3, (d) *n* = 3, *l* = 2 #### **Solution** | | n | l | orbital | | |----|---|---|---------|--| | a) | 2 | 1 | 2p | | | b) | 4 | 0 | 4s | | | c) | 5 | 3 | 5f | | | d) | 3 | 2 | 3d | | | | | | | | #### **2.6.2 Shapes of Atomic Orbitals** The orbital wave function or \u03c8 for an electron in an atom has no physical meaning. It is simply a mathematical function of the coordinates of the electron. However, for different orbitals the plots of corresponding wave functions as a function of *r* (the distance from the nucleus) are different. Fig. 2.12(a), gives such plots for 1*s* (*n* = 1, *l* = 0) and 2*s* (*n* = 2, *l* = 0) orbitals. ![](_page_28_Figure_16.jpeg) ![](_page_28_Figure_17.jpeg) According to the German physicist, Max Born, the square of the wave function (i.e.,\u03c8<sup>2<\/sup> ) at a point gives the probability density of the electron at that point. The variation of \u03c82 as a function of *r* for 1*s* and 2*s* orbitals is given in Fig. 2.12(b). Here again, you may note that the curves for 1*s* and 2*s* orbitals are different. It may be noted that for 1*s* orbital the probability density is maximum at the nucleus and it decreases sharply as we move away from it. On the other hand, for 2*s* orbital the probability density first decreases sharply to zero and again starts increasing. After reaching a small maxima it decreases again and approaches zero as the value of *r* increases further. The region where this probability density function reduces to zero is called **nodal surfaces** or simply **nodes**.

In these diagrams, the density Unit 2.indd 57 9\/9\/2022 4:28:17 PM 58 chemistry of the dots in a region represents electron probability density in that region. **Boundary surface diagrams** of constant probability density for different orbitals give a fairly good representation of the shapes of the orbitals. In this representation, a boundary surface or contour surface is drawn in space for an orbital on which the value of probability density |\u03c8|<sup>2<\/sup> is constant. In principle many such boundary surfaces may be possible. However, for a given orbital, only that boundary surface diagram of constant probability density\\* is taken to be good representation of the shape of the orbital which encloses a region or volume in which the probability of finding the electron is very high, say, 90%. The boundary surface diagram for 1*s* and 2*s* orbitals are given in Fig. 2.13(b). One may ask a question : Why do we not draw a boundary surface diagram, which bounds a region in which the probability of finding the electron is, 100 %? The answer to this question is that the probability density |\u03c8|<sup>2<\/sup> has always some value, howsoever small it may be, at any finite distance from the nucleus. It is therefore, not possible to draw a boundary surface diagram of a rigid size in which the probability of finding the electron is 100%. Boundary surface diagram for a *s* orbital is actually a sphere centred on the nucleus. In two dimensions, this sphere looks like a circle. It encloses a region in which probability of finding the electron is about 90%. Thus, we see that 1*s* and 2*s* orbitals are spherical in shape. In reality all the *s*-orbitals are spherically symmetric, that is, the probability of finding the electron at a given distance is equal in all the directions. It is also observed that the size of the s orbital increases with increase in *n*, that is, 4*s* > 3*s* > 2*s* > 1*s* and the electron is located further away from the nucleus as the principal quantum number increases. Boundary surface diagrams for three 2*p* orbitals (*l* = 1) are shown in Fig. 2.14. In ![](_page_29_Figure_5.jpeg) *Fig. 2.13 (a) Probability density plots of 1s and 2s atomic orbitals.

The size, shape and energy of the three orbitals are identical. They differ however, in the way the lobes are oriented. Since the lobes may be considered to lie along the x, y or z axis, they are given the designations 2*px* , 2*py*, and 2*pz* . It should be understood, however, that *there is no simple relation between the values of ml (\u20131, 0 and +1) and the x, y and z directions.* For our purpose, ![](_page_0_Figure_2.jpeg) *Fig. 2.15 Boundary surface diagrams of the five 3d orbitals.* it is sufficient to remember that, because there are three possible values of *ml* , there are, therefore, three *p* orbitals whose axes are mutually perpendicular. Like *s* orbitals, *p* orbitals increase in size and energy with increase in the principal quantum number and hence the order of the energy and size of various *p* orbitals is 4*p* > 3*p* > 2*p*. Further, like s orbitals, the probability density functions for *p*-orbital also pass through value zero, besides at zero and infinite distance, as the distance from the nucleus increases. The number of nodes are given by the *n* \u20132, that is number of radial node is 1 for 3*p* orbital, two for 4*p* orbital and so on. For *l* = 2, the orbital is known as *d*-orbital and the minimum value of principal quantum number (*n*) has to be 3. as the value of *l* cannot be greater than *n*\u20131. There are five *ml* values (\u20132, \u20131, 0, +1 and +2) for *l* = 2 and thus there are five *d* orbitals. The boundary surface diagram of *d* orbitals are shown in Fig. 2.15. The five *d*-orbitals are designated as *d*xy, *d*yz, *d*xz, *d*x2\u2013y2 and *d*z2. The shapes of the first four *d*-orbitals are similar to each other, where as that of the fifth one, *d*z2, is different from others, but all five 3*d* orbitals are equivalent in energy. The *d* orbitals for which *n* is greater than 3 (4*d*, 5*d*...) also have shapes similar to 3*d* orbital, but differ in energy and size. Besides the radial nodes (i.e., probability density function is zero), the probability density functions for the n*p* and n*d* orbitals are zero at the plane (s), passing through the nucleus (origin). For example, in case of *p*<sup>z<\/sup> orbital, xy-plane is a nodal plane, in case of *d*xy orbital, there are two nodal planes passing through the origin and bisecting the xy plane containing z-axis. These are called angular nodes and number of angular nodes are given by '*l*', i.e., one angular node for *p* orbitals, two angular nodes for '*d*' orbitals and so on. **The total number of nodes are given by (***n***\u20131), i.e.,** *sum of l* **angular nodes and (***n* **\u2013** *l* **\u2013 1) radial nodes.** ### **2.6.3 Energies of Orbitals** The energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom is"

Thus the energy of the orbitals in hydrogen atom increases as follows : 1*s* < 2*s* = 2*p* < 3*s* = 3*p* = 3*d* <4*s* = 4*p* = 4*d* = 4*f* < (2.23) and is depicted in Fig. 2.16. Although the shapes of 2*s* and 2*p* orbitals are different, an electron has the same energy when it is in the 2*s* orbital as when it is present in 2*p* orbital. The orbitals having the same energy are called **degenerate.** The 1*s* orbital in a hydrogen atom, as said earlier, corresponds to the most stable condition and is called the **ground state** and an electron residing in this orbital is most strongly held by the nucleus. An electron in the 2*s*, 2*p* or higher orbitals in a hydrogen atom is in **excited state.** ![](_page_1_Figure_3.jpeg) *Fig. 2.16 Energy level diagrams for the few electronic shells of (a) hydrogen atom and (b) multi-electronic atoms. Note that orbitals for the same value of principal quantum number, have the same energies even for different azimuthal quantum number for hydrogen atom. In case of multi-electron atoms, orbitals with same principal quantum number possess different energies for different azimuthal quantum numbers.* The energy of an electron in a multielectron atom, unlike that of the hydrogen atom, depends not only on its principal quantum number (shell), but also on its azimuthal quantum number (subshell). That is, for a given principal quantum number, *s*, *p*, *d*, *f* ... all have different energies. Within a given principal quantum number, the energy of orbitals increases in the order *s*<*p*<*d*<*f*. For higher energy levels, these differences are sufficiently pronounced and straggering of orbital energy may result, e.g., 4*s*<3*d* and 6*s*<5*d*; 4*f*<6*p*. The main reason for having different energies of the subshells is the mutual repulsion among the electrons in multi-electron atoms. The only electrical interaction present in hydrogen atom is the attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged nucleus. In multi-electron atoms, besides the presence of attraction between the electron and nucleus, there are repulsion terms between every electron and other electrons present in the atom. Thus the stability of an electron in a multi-electron atom is because total attractive interactions are more than the repulsive interactions. In general, the repulsive interaction of the electrons in the outer shell with the electrons in the inner shell are more important. On the other hand, the attractive interactions of an electron increases with increase of positive charge (*Ze*) on the nucleus. Due to the presence of electrons in the inner shells, the electron in the outer shell will not experience the full positive charge of the nucleus (*Ze*). The effect will be lowered due to the partial screening of positive charge on the nucleus by the inner shell electrons. This is known as the **shielding of the outer shell electrons from the nucleus by the inner shell electrons,** and the net positive charge experienced by the outer electrons is known as **effective nuclear charge** (*Z*eff *e*). Despite the shielding of the outer electrons from the nucleus by the inner shell electrons, the attractive force experienced by the outer shell electrons increases with increase of nuclear charge. In other words, the energy of interaction between, the nucleus and electron Unit 2.indd 60 9\/9\/2022 4:28:20 PM (that is orbital energy) decreases (that is more negative) with the increase of atomic number (*Z*). Both the attractive and repulsive interactions depend upon the shell and shape of the orbital in which the electron is present. For example electrons present in spherical shaped, *s* orbital shields the outer electrons from the nucleus more effectively as compared to electrons present in *p* orbital. Similarly electrons present in *p* orbitals shield the outer electrons from the nucleus more than the electrons present in *d* orbitals, even though all these orbitals are present in the same shell. Further within a shell, due to spherical shape of *s* orbital, the *s* orbital electron spends more time close to the nucleus in comparison to *p* orbital electron which spends more time in the vicinity of nucleus in comparison to *d* orbital electron. In other words, for a given shell (principal quantum number), the Zeff experienced by the electron decreases with increase of azimuthal quantum number (*l*), that is, the *s orbital electron will be more tightly bound to the nucleus than p orbital electron which in turn will be better tightly bound than the d orbital electron*. The energy of electrons in *s* orbital will be lower (more negative) than that of *p* orbital electron which will have less energy than that of *d* orbital electron and so on. Since the extent of shielding from the nucleus is different for electrons in different orbitals, it leads to the splitting of energy levels within the same shell (or same principal quantum number), that is, energy of electron in an orbital, as mentioned earlier, depends upon the values of *n* and *l*. Mathematically, the dependence of energies of the orbitals on *n* and *l* are quite complicated but one simple rule is that, **the lower the value of (***n* **+** *l***) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same value of (***n* **+** *l***), the orbital with lower value of** *n* **will have the lower energy.** The Table 2.5 illustrates the (*n* + *l* ) rule and Fig. 2.16 depicts the energy levels of multielectrons atoms.

The building up of orbitals means the Unit 2.indd 61 9\/9\/2022 4:28:20 PM filling up of orbitals with electrons. The principle states : **In the ground state of the atoms, the orbitals are filled in order of their increasing energies.** In other words, electrons first occupy the lowest energy orbital available to them and enter into higher energy orbitals only after the lower energy orbitals are filled. As you have learnt above, energy of a given orbital depends upon effective nuclear charge and different type of orbitals are affected to different extent. Thus, there is no single ordering of energies of orbitals which will be universally correct for all atoms. However, following order of energies of the orbitals is extremely useful: 1*s*, 2*s*, 2*p*, 3*s*, 3*p*, 4*s*, 3*d*, 4*p*, 5*s*, 4*d*, 5*p*, 6*s*, 4*f*, 5*d*, 6*p*, 7*s*... The order may be remembered by using the method given in Fig. 2.17. Starting from ![](_page_3_Figure_5.jpeg) 62 chemistry the top, the direction of the arrows gives the order of filling of orbitals, that is starting from right top to bottom left. With respect to placement of outermost valence electrons, it is remarkably accurate for all atoms. for example, valence electron in potassium must choose between 3*d* and 4*s* orbitals and as predicted by this sequence, it is found in 4*s* orbital. The above order should be assumed to be a rough guide to the filling of energy levels. In many cases, the orbitals are similar in energy and small changes in atomic structure may bring about a change in the order of filling. Even then, the above series is a useful guide to the building of the electronic structure of an atom provided that it is remembered that exceptions may occur. ### *Pauli Exclusion Principle* The number of electrons to be filled in various orbitals is restricted by the exclusion principle, given by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli (1926). According to this principle : **No two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers.** Pauli exclusion principle can also be stated as : **\"Only two electrons may exist in the same orbital and these electrons must have opposite spin.\"** This means that the two electrons can have the same value of three quantum numbers *n*, *l* and *ml* , but must have the opposite spin quantum number. The restriction imposed by Pauli's exclusion principle on the number of electrons in an orbital helps in calculating the capacity of electrons to be present in any subshell. For example, subshell 1*s* comprises one orbital and thus the maximum number of electrons present in 1*s* subshell can be two, in *p* and *d* subshells, the maximum number of electrons can be 6 and 10 and so on. This can be summed up as : **the maximum number of electrons in the shell with principal quantum number** *n* **is equal to 2***n***2.** #### *Hund's Rule of Maximum Multiplicity* This rule deals with the filling of electrons into the orbitals belonging to the same subshell (that is, orbitals of equal energy, called **degenerate orbitals).** It states : **pairing of** *Fig.2.17 Order of filling of orbitals* Unit 2.indd 62 09\/08\/2024 15:20:29 # **electrons in the orbitals belonging to the same subshell (***p***,** *d* **or** *f***) does not take place until each orbital belonging to that subshell has got one electron each i.e., it is singly occupied.** Since there are three *p*, five *d* and seven *f* orbitals, therefore, the pairing of electrons will start in the *p*, *d* and *f* orbitals with the entry of 4th, 6th and 8th electron, respectively. It has been observed that half filled and fully filled degenerate set of orbitals acquire extra stability due to their symmetry (see Section, 2.6.7). #### **2.6.5 Electronic Configuration of Atoms** The distribution of electrons into orbitals of an atom is called its **electronic configuration**. If one keeps in mind the basic rules which govern the filling of different atomic orbitals, the electronic configurations of different atoms can be written very easily. The electronic configuration of different atoms can be represented in two ways. For example : - (i) *s*<sup>a<\/sup> *p*<sup>b<\/sup>*d*c ...... notation - (ii) Orbital diagram *s p d* In the first notation, the subshell is represented by the respective letter symbol and the number of electrons present in the subshell is depicted, as the super script, like a, b, c, ... etc. The similar subshell represented for different shells is differentiated by writing the principal quantum number before the respective subshell. In the second notation each orbital of the subshell is represented by a box and the electron is represented by an arrow (\u2191) a positive spin or"

The hydrogen atom has only one electron which goes in the orbital with the lowest energy, namely 1*s*. The electronic configuration of the hydrogen atom is 1*s*1 meaning that it has one electron in the 1*s* orbital. The second electron in helium (He) can also occupy the 1*s* orbital. Its configuration is, therefore, 1*s*2. As mentioned above, the two electrons differ from each other with opposite spin, as can be seen from the orbital diagram. $$\\begin{array}{ccc} \\text{H} & \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{c} \\end{array} \\end{array} \\end{array} \\end{array} & \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{c} \\text{He} \\end{array} \\end{array} \\end{array} & \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{c} \\end{array} \\end{array} \\end{array} \\end{array} \\end{array} \\end{array}$$ The third electron of lithium (Li) is not allowed in the 1*s* orbital because of Pauli exclusion principle. It, therefore, takes the next available choice, namely the 2*s* orbital. The electronic configuration of Li is 1*s*22*s*1. The 2*s* orbital can accommodate one more electron. The configuration of beryllium (Be) atom is, therefore, 1*s*2 2*s*2 (see Table 2.6, page 66 for the electronic configurations of elements). In the next six elements\u2014boron (B, 1*s*22*s*22*p*1), carbon (C, 1*s*22*s*22*p*2), nitrogen (N, 1*s*22*s*22*p*3), oxygen (O, 1*s*22*s*22*p*<sup>4<\/sup>), fluorine (F, 1*s*22*s*22*p*5) and neon (Ne, 1*s*22*s*22*p*6), the 2*p* orbitals get progressively filled. This process is completed with the neon atom. The orbital picture of these elements can be represented as follows : | Li | 11 | 1 | | | | |----|-----|----|----|------|----| | Be | 1.5 | \u30a4 | | | | | B | \u3067\u3059 | \u30a4\u30ec | 1 | | | | C | \u3067\u3059 | \u30eb\u30c8 | 1 | 1 | | | N | \u30a4\u30ec | \u4e2a\u4eba | \u2191 | 1 | > | | O | \u30fc | \u4e2a\u4eba | \u4e2a\u4eba | \u4e2a | 1 | | F | \u304f\u3057 | \u4e2a\u4eba | \u4e2a\u4eba | 14 | \u4e2a | | Ne | \u30fc | \u4e2a\u4eba | \u304f\u3057 | 1 14 | \u4e2a\u4eba | | | l s | 25 | | 2p | | The electronic configuration of the elements sodium (Na,1*s*22*s*22*p*63*s*1) to argon (Ar,1*s*22*s*22*p*63*s*23*p*6), follow exactly the same pattern as the elements from lithium to neon with the difference that the 3*s* and 3*p* orbitals are getting filled now. This process can be simplified if we represent the total number of electrons in the first two shells by the name of element neon (Ne). The electronic configuration of the elements from sodium to Unit 2.indd 63 9\/9\/2022 4:28:21 PM argon can be written as (Na, [Ne]3*s*1) to (Ar, [Ne] 3*s*23*p*6). The electrons in the completely filled shells are known as core electrons and the electrons that are added to the electronic shell with the highest principal quantum number are called **valence electrons.** For example, the electrons in Ne are the core electrons and the electrons from Na to Ar are the valence electrons. In potassium (K) and calcium (Ca), the 4*s* orbital, being lower in energy than the 3*d* orbitals, is occupied by one and two electrons respectively. A new pattern is followed beginning with scandium (Sc). The 3*d* orbital, being lower in energy than the 4*p* orbital, is filled first. Consequently, in the next ten elements, scandium (Sc), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), the five 3*d* orbitals are progressively occupied. We may be puzzled by the fact that chromium and copper have five and ten electrons in 3*d* orbitals rather than four and nine as their position would have indicated with two-electrons in the 4s orbital. The reason is that fully filled orbitals and halffilled orbitals have extra stability (that is, lower energy). Thus *p*3, *p*6, *d*5, *d*10,*f* 7, *f*14 etc. configurations, which are either half-filled or fully filled, are more stable. Chromium and copper therefore adopt the *d*5 and *d*10 configuration (Section 2.6.7)[*caution: exceptions do exist*] With the saturation of the 3*d* orbitals, the filling of the 4*p* orbital starts at gallium (Ga) and is complete at krypton (Kr). In the next eighteen elements from rubidium (Rb) to xenon (Xe), the pattern of filling the 5*s*, 4*d* and 5*p* orbitals are similar to that of 4*s*, 3*d* and 4*p* orbitals as discussed above. Then comes the turn of the 6*s* orbital. In caesium (Cs) and the barium (Ba), this orbital contains one and two electrons, respectively. Then from lanthanum (La) to mercury (Hg), the filling up of electrons takes place in 4*f* and 5*d* orbitals. After this, filling of 6*p*, then 7*s* and finally 5*f* and 6*d* orbitals takes place. The elements after uranium (U) are all short-lived and all of them are produced artificially. The electronic configurations of the known elements (as determined by spectroscopic methods) are tabulated in Table 2.6 (page 66). One may ask what is the utility of knowing the electron configuration? The modern approach to the chemistry, infact, depends almost entirely on electronic distribution to understand and explain chemical behaviour. For example, questions like why two or more atoms combine to form molecules, why some elements are metals while others are nonmetals, why elements like helium and argon are not reactive but elements like the halogens are reactive, find simple explanation from the electronic configuration. These questions have no answer in the Daltonian model of atom. A detailed understanding of the electronic structure of atom is, therefore, very essential for getting an insight into the various aspects of modern chemical knowledge. # **2.6.6 Stability of Completely Filled and Half Filled Subshells** The ground state electronic configuration of the atom of an element always corresponds to the state of the lowest total electronic energy. The electronic configurations of most of the atoms follow the basic rules given in Section 2.6.5. However, in certain elements such as Cu, or Cr, where the two subshells (4*s* and 3*d*) differ slightly in their energies, an electron shifts from a subshell of lower energy (4*s*)"

Unit 2.indd 64 9\/9\/2022 4:28:21 PM #### **Causes of Stability of Completely Filled and Half-filled Subshells** The completely filled and completely half-filled subshells are stable due to the following reasons: *1 . Symm e t r i ca l d i s t r ibu t ion o f electrons:* It is well known that symmetry leads to stability. The completely filled or half filled subshells have symmetrical distribution of electrons in them and are therefore more stable. Electrons in the same subshell (here *3d*) have equal energy but different spatial distribution. Consequently, their shielding of oneanother is relatively small and the electrons are more strongly attracted by the nucleus. *2. Exchange Energy :* The stabilizing effect arises whenever two or more electrons with the same spin are present in the degenerate orbitals of a subshell. These electrons tend to exchange their positions and the energy released due to this exchange is called exchange energy. The number of exchanges that can take place is maximum when the subshell is either half filled or completely filled (Fig. 2.18). As a result the exchange energy is maximum and so is the stability. You may note that the exchange energy is at the basis of Hund's rule that electrons which enter orbitals of equal energy have parallel spins as far as possible. In other words, the extra stability of half-filled and completely filled subshell is due to: (i) relatively small shielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion energy, and (iii) larger exchange energy. Details about the exchange energy will be dealt with in higher classes. ![](_page_6_Figure_6.jpeg) *configuration* Unit 2.indd 65 9\/9\/2022 4:28:21 PM | Element Z | 15 | 25 | 2p | \u0ab0\u0ac7\u0a95

        "question":"As the Chief Examiner for JEE Advanced, could you elucidate how the Heisenberg uncertainty principle fundamentally challenges the assumptions made in the Bohr model regarding electron behavior within an atom, and what implications this has for understanding atomic structure?",
        "answer":"The Bohr model regards an electron as a charged particle moving in a well-defined circular orbit about the nucleus, ignoring its wave character. This assumption of a clearly defined path requires knowing both the exact position and exact velocity of the electron simultaneously, which is impossible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Consequently, the Bohr model contradicts the Heisenberg uncertainty principle by not accounting for the dual behavior of the electron, thereby posing limitations in accurately describing atomic stability and electronic structure.",

            "Summary** **Atoms** are the building blocks of elements. They are the smallest parts of an element that chemically react. The first atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, regarded atom as the ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was proved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles: **electrons**, **protons** and **neutrons**. The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal of various atomic models to explain the structure of atom. Thomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity with electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to be evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford's famous alpha-particle scattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively charged **nucleus**, at its centre with electrons revolving around it in **circular orbits**. **Rutherford model**, which resembles the solar system, was no doubt an improvement over **Thomson model** but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e., why the electron does not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of atoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The difficulties of the Rutherford model were overcome by Niels Bohr in 1913 in his model of the hydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in circular orbits. Only certain orbits can exist and each orbit corresponds to a specific energy. Bohr calculated the energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the electron and nucleus. **Bohr model**, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the spectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron atoms. The reason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged particle moving in a well defined circular orbit about the nucleus. The wave character of the electron is ignored in Bohr's theory. An orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can completely be defined only if both the exact position and the exact velocity of the electron at the same time are known. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour of electron but also contradicts **Heisenberg uncertainty principle**. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schr\u00f6dinger equation to describe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This equation incorporates de Broglie's concept of **wave-particle duality** and is consistent with Heisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schr\u00f6dinger equation is solved for the electron in a hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and the corresponding wave function(s) (\u03c8) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the electron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (**principal quantum number** *n*, **azimuthal quantum number** *l* and **magnetic quantum number** *ml* ) arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The restrictions on the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model. According to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an atom containing a number of electrons is divided into **shells**. The shells, in turn, are thought to consist of one or more **subshells** and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or more orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems (such as He+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of the orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of *n* and *l*: The lower the value of (*n + l* ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (*n + l* ) value, the orbital with lower value of *n* has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are Unit 2.indd 68 9\/9\/2022 4:28:23 PM possible and electrons are filled in those orbitals in order of increasing energy in accordance with **Pauli exclusion principle** (no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers) and **Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity** (pairing of electrons in the orbitals belonging to the same subshell does not take place until each orbital belonging to that subshell has got one electron each, i.e., is singly occupied). This forms the basis of the electronic structure of atoms. #### **"

            "3.2 GENESIS OF PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION** Classification of elements into groups and development of Periodic Law and Periodic Table are the consequences of systematising the knowledge gained by a number of scientists through their observations and experiments. The German chemist, Johann Dobereiner in early 1800's was the first to consider the idea of trends among properties of elements. By 1829 he noted a similarity among the physical and chemical properties of several groups of three elements (**Triads**). In each case, he noticed that the middle element of each of the **Triads** had an atomic weight about half way between the atomic weights of the other two (Table 3.1). Also the properties of the middle element were in between those of the other two members. Since Dobereiner's the periodic recurrence of properties. This also did not attract much attention. The English chemist, John Alexander Newlands in 1865 profounded the **Law of Octaves**. He arranged the elements in increasing order of their atomic weights and noted that every eighth element had properties similar to the first element (Table 3.2). The relationship was just like every eighth note that resembles the first in octaves of music. Newlands's Law of Octaves seemed to be true only for elements up to calcium. Although his idea was not widely accepted at that time, he, for his work, was later awarded Davy Medal in 1887 by the Royal Society, London. The Periodic Law, as we know it today owes its development to the Russian chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) and the German chemist, Lothar Meyer (1830-1895). | Element | Atomic<br>weight | Element | Atomic<br>weight | Element | Atomic<br>weight | |---------|------------------|---------|------------------|---------|------------------| | Li | 7 | Ca | 40 | Cl | 35.5 | | Na | 23 | Sr | 88 | Br | 80 | | K | 39 | Ba | 137 | I | 127 | **Table 3.1 Dobereiner's Triads** relationship, referred to as the **Law of Triads**, seemed to work only for a few elements, it was dismissed as coincidence. The next reported attempt to classify elements was made by a French geologist, A.E.B. de Chancourtois in 1862. He arranged the then known elements in order of increasing atomic weights and made a cylindrical table of elements to display Working independently, both the chemists in 1869 proposed that on arranging elements in the increasing order of their atomic weights, similarities appear in physical and chemical properties at regular intervals. Lothar Meyer plotted the physical properties such as atomic volume, melting point and boiling point against atomic weight and obtained | Element | Li | Be | B | C | N | O | F | |---------|----|----|----|----|----|----|------| | At. wt. | 7 | 9 | 11 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 19 | | Element | Na | Mg | Al | Si | P | S | Cl | | At. wt. | 23 | 24 | 27 | 29 | 31 | 32 | 35.5 | | Element | K | Ca | | | | | | | At. wt. | 39 | 40 | | | | | | Unit 3.indd 75 9\/9\/2022 4:36:12 PM # **Table 3.2 Newlands' Octaves** a periodically repeated pattern. Unlike Newlands, Lothar Meyer observed a change in length of that repeating pattern. By 1868, Lothar Meyer had developed a table of the elements that closely resembles the Modern Periodic Table. However, his work was not published until after the work of Dmitri Mendeleev, the scientist who is generally credited with the development of the Modern Periodic Table. While Dobereiner initiated the study of periodic relationship, it was Mendeleev who was responsible for publishing the Periodic Law for the first time. It states as follows : # *The properties of the elements are a periodic function of their atomic weights.* Mendeleev arranged elements in horizontal rows and vertical columns of a table in order of their increasing atomic weights in such a way that the elements with similar properties occupied the same vertical column or group. Mendeleev's system of classifying elements was more elaborate than that of Lothar Meyer's. He fully recognized the significance of periodicity and used broader range of physical and chemical properties to classify the elements. In particular, Mendeleev relied on the similarities in the empirical formulas and properties of the compounds formed by the elements. He realized that some of the elements did not fit in with his scheme of classification if the order of atomic weight was strictly followed. He ignored the order of atomic weights, thinking that the atomic measurements might be incorrect, and placed the elements with similar properties together. For example, iodine with lower atomic weight than that of tellurium (Group VI) was placed in Group VII along with fluorine, chlorine, bromine because of similarities in properties (Fig. 3.1). At the same time, keeping his primary aim of arranging the elements of similar properties in the same group, he proposed that some of the elements were still undiscovered and, therefore, left several gaps in the table. For example, both gallium and germanium were unknown at the time Mendeleev published his Periodic Table. He left the gap under aluminium and a gap under silicon, and called these elements **Eka-Aluminium** and **Eka-Silicon**. Mendeleev predicted not only the existence of gallium and germanium, but also described some of their general physical properties. These elements were discovered later. Some of the properties predicted by Mendeleev for these elements and those found experimentally are listed in Table 3.3. The boldness of Mendeleev's quantitative predictions and their eventual success made him and his Periodic Table famous. Mendeleev's Periodic Table published in 1905 is shown in Fig. 3.1. | Property | Eka-aluminium<br>(predicted) | Gallium<br>(found) | Eka-silicon<br>(predicted) | Germanium<br>(found) | | | |---------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|--|--| | Atomic weight | 68 | 70 | 72 | 72.6 | | | | Density\/(g\/cm3) | 5.9 | 5.94 | 5.5 | 5.36 | | | | Melting point\/K | Low | 302.93 | High | 1231 | | | |"

It is the everyday support for students, it suggests new avenues of research to professionals, and it provides a succinct organization of the whole of chemistry. It is a remarkable demonstration of the fact that the chemical elements are not a random cluster of entities but instead display trends and lie together in families. An awareness of the Periodic Table is essential to anyone who wishes to disentangle the world and see how it is built up from the fundamental building blocks of the chemistry, the chemical elements.* #### *Glenn T. Seaborg* In this Unit, we will study the historical development of the Periodic Table as it stands today and the Modern Periodic Law. We will also learn how the periodic classification follows as a logical consequence of the electronic configuration of atoms. Finally, we shall examine some of the periodic trends in the physical and chemical properties of the elements. # ** 3.1 WHY DO WE NEED TO CLASSIFY ELEMENTS ?** We know by now that the elements are the basic units of all types of matter. In 1800, only 31 elements were known. By 1865, the number of identified elements had more than doubled to 63. At present 114 elements are known. Of them, the recently discovered elements are man-made. Efforts to synthesise new elements are continuing. With such a large number of elements it is very difficult to study individually the chemistry of all these elements and their innumerable compounds individually. To ease out this problem, scientists searched for a systematic way to organise their knowledge by classifying the elements. Not only that it would rationalize known chemical facts about elements, but even predict new ones for undertaking further study.

However, the beginning of the 20th century witnessed profound developments in theories about sub-atomic particles. In 1913, the English physicist, Henry Moseley observed regularities in the characteristic *X-ray spectra* of the elements. A plot of (where is frequency of *X*-rays emitted) against atomic number (*Z*) gave a straight line and not the plot of *vs* atomic mass. He thereby showed that the atomic number is a more fundamental property of an element than its atomic mass. **Mendeleev's Periodic Law** was, therefore, accordingly modified. This is known as the **Modern Periodic Law** and can be stated as : *The physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers.* The **Periodic Law** revealed important analogies among the 94 naturally occurring elements (neptunium and plutonium like actinium and protoactinium are also found in pitch blende \u2013 an ore of uranium). It stimulated renewed interest in Inorganic Chemistry and has carried into the present with the creation of artificially produced short-lived elements. You may recall that the atomic number is equal to the nuclear charge (*i.e.*, number of protons) or the number of electrons in a neutral atom. It is then easy to visualize the significance of quantum numbers and electronic configurations in periodicity of elements. In fact, it is now recognized that the Periodic Law is essentially the consequence of the periodic variation in electronic configurations, which indeed determine the physical and chemical properties of elements and their compounds. Numerous forms of Periodic Table have been devised from time to time. Some forms emphasise chemical reactions and valence, whereas others stress the electronic configuration of elements. A modern version, the so-called \"**long form**\" of the **Periodic Table** of the elements (Fig. 3.2), is the most convenient and widely used. The horizontal rows (which Mendeleev called **series**) are called **periods** and the vertical columns, **groups**. Elements having similar outer electronic configurations in their atoms are arranged in vertical columns, referred to as **groups** or **families**. According to the recommendation of International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the groups are numbered from 1 to 18 replacing the older notation of groups IA \u2026 VIIA, VIII, IB \u2026 VIIB and 0. There are altogether seven periods. The period number corresponds to the highest principal quantum number (*n*) of the elements in the period. The first period contains 2 elements. The subsequent periods consists of 8, 8, 18, 18 and 32 elements, respectively. The seventh period is incomplete and like the sixth period would have a theoretical maximum (on the basis of quantum numbers) of 32 elements. In this form of the Periodic Table, 14 elements of both sixth and seventh periods (lanthanoids and actinoids, respectively) are placed in separate panels at the bottom\\*. # ** | | | | | 5 | pent | p | | | | | | | 6 | hex | h | | | | | | | 7 | sept | s | | | | | | | 8 | oct | o | | | | | | | 9 | enn | e | | | | | | # **Table 3.4 Notation for IUPAC Nomenclature of Elements** | Atomic<br>Number | Name according to<br>IUPAC nomenclature | Symbol | IUPAC<br>Official Name | IUPAC<br>Symbol | |------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------|------------------------|-----------------| | 101 | Unnilunium | Unu | Mendelevium | Md | | 102 | Unnilbium | Unb | Nobelium | No | | 103 | Unniltrium | Unt | Lawrencium | Lr | | 104 | Unnilquadium | Unq | Rutherfordium | Rf | | 105 | Unnilpentium | Unp | Dubnium | Db | | 106 | Unnilhexium | Unh | Seaborgium | Sg | | 107 | Unnilseptium | Uns | Bohrium | Bh | | 108 | Unniloctium | Uno | Hassium | Hs | | 109 | Unnilennium | Une | Meitnerium | Mt | | 110 | Ununnillium | Uun | Darmstadtium | Ds | | 111 | Unununnium | Uuu | Rontgenium | Rg | | 112 | Ununbium | Uub | Copernicium | Cn | | 113 | Ununtrium | Uut | Nihonium | Nh | | 114 | Ununquadium | Uuq | Flerovium | Fl | | 115 | Ununpentium | Uup | Moscovium | Mc | | 116 | Ununhexium | Uuh | Livermorium | Lv | | 117 | Ununseptium | Uus | Tennessine | Ts | | 118 | Ununoctium | Uuo | Oganesson | Og | Unit 3.indd 80 9\/9\/2022 4:36:13 PM # **Table 3.5 Nomenclature of Elements with Atomic Number Above 100** Thus, the new element first gets a temporary name, with symbol consisting of three letters.

As of now, elements with atomic numbers up to 118 have been discovered. Official names of all elements have been announced by IUPAC. #### **Problem 3.1** What would be the IUPAC name and symbol for the element with atomic number 120? #### **Solution** From Table 3.4, the roots for 1, 2 and 0 are un, bi and nil, respectively.

        "answer":"When n = 5, the possible values for l are 0, 1, 2, and 3, corresponding to the 5s, 5p, 5d, and 5f orbitals. However, the order of increasing energy for the orbitals being filled in the 5th period is 5s < 4d < 5p. The total number of orbitals available for filling in this period are the 5s orbital (1 orbital), the 4d orbitals (5 orbitals), and the 5p orbitals (3 orbitals), totaling 9 orbitals. Since each orbital can accommodate a maximum of 2 electrons, the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in these 9 orbitals is 18. Therefore, there are 18 elements in the 5th period.",

            "3.5 ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS OF ELEMENTS AND THE PERIODIC TABLE** In the preceding unit we have learnt that an electron in an atom is characterised by a set of four quantum numbers, and the principal quantum number (*n* ) defines the main energy level known as **shell**. We have also studied about the filling of electrons into different subshells, also referred to as **orbitals** (*s, p, d, f* ) in an atom. The distribution of electrons into orbitals of an atom is called its **electronic configuration**. An element's location in the Periodic Table reflects the quantum numbers of the last orbital filled. In this section we will observe a direct connection between the electronic configurations of the elements and the long form of the Periodic Table. #### *(a) Electronic Configurations in Periods* The period indicates the value of *n* for the outermost or valence shell. In other words, successive period in the Periodic Table is associated with the filling of the next higher principal energy level (*n* = 1, *n* = 2, etc.). It can Unit 3.indd 81 9\/9\/2022 4:36:13 PM be readily seen that the number of elements in each period is twice the number of atomic **orbitals** available in the energy level that is being filled. The first period (*n* = 1) starts with the filling of the lowest level (1*s*) and therefore has two elements \u2014 hydrogen (l*s*1) and helium (l*s*<sup>2<\/sup>) when the first shell (*K*) is completed. The second period (*n* = 2) starts with lithium and the third electron enters the 2*s* orbital. The next element, beryllium has four electrons and has the electronic configuration 1*s*22*s*2. Starting from the next element boron, the 2*p* orbitals are filled with electrons when the *L* shell is completed at neon (2*s*22*p*6). Thus there are 8 elements in the second period. The third period (*n* = 3) begins at sodium, and the added electron enters a 3*s* orbital. Successive filling of 3*s* and 3*p* orbitals gives rise to the third period of 8 elements from sodium to argon. The fourth period (*n* = 4) starts at potassium, and the added electrons fill up the 4*s* orbital. Now you may note that before the 4*p* orbital is filled, filling up of 3*d* orbitals becomes energetically favourable and we come across the so called 3*d* **transition series** of elements. This starts from scandium (*Z* = 21) which has the electronic configuration 3*d*14*s*2. The 3*d* orbitals are filled at zinc (*Z*=30) with electronic configuration 3*d*104*s*2. The fourth period ends at krypton with the filling up of the 4*p* orbitals. Altogether we have 18 elements in this fourth period. The fifth period (*n* = 5) beginning with rubidium is similar to the fourth period and contains the 4*d* **transition series** starting at yttrium (*Z* = 39). This period ends at xenon with the filling up of the 5*p* orbitals. The sixth period (*n* = 6) contains 32 elements and successive electrons enter 6*s*, 4*f*, 5*d* and 6*p* orbitals, in the order \u2014 filling up of the 4*f* orbitals begins with cerium (*Z* = 58) and ends at lutetium (*Z* = 71) to give the 4*f*-**inner transition series** which is called the **lanthanoid series**. The seventh period (*n* = 7) is similar to the sixth period with the successive filling up of the 7*s*, 5*f*, 6*d* and 7*p* orbitals and includes most of the man-made radioactive elements. This period will end at the element with atomic number 118 which would belong to the noble gas family. Filling up of the 5*f* orbitals after actinium (*Z* = 89) gives the 5*f*-**inner transition series** known as the **actinoid series**. The 4*f*and 5*f*-**inner transition series** of elements are placed separately in the Periodic Table to maintain its structure and to preserve the principle of classification by keeping elements with similar properties in a single column. ### **Problem 3.2** How would you justify the presence of 18 elements in the 5th period of the Periodic Table? #### **Solution** When *n* = 5, *l* = 0, 1, 2, 3. The order in which the energy of the available orbitals 4*d*, 5*s* and 5*p* increases is 5*s* < 4*d* < 5*p*. The total number of orbitals available are 9. The maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated is 18; and therefore 18 elements are there in the 5th period. # *(b) Groupwise Electronic Configurations* Elements in the same vertical column or group have similar valence shell electronic configurations, the same number of electrons in the outer orbitals, and similar properties. For example, the Group 1 elements (alkali metals) all have *ns*1 valence shell electronic configuration as shown below. a theoretical foundation for the periodic classification.The elements ina vertical column of the Periodic Table constitute a group or family and exhibit similar chemical behaviour. This similarity arises because these elements have the same number and same distribution of electrons in their outermost orbitals. We can classify the elements into four blocks *viz*., *s***-block,** *p***-block,** *d***-block** and *f***-block** depending on the type of atomic orbitals that are being filled withelectrons. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.3. We notice two exceptions to this categorisation. Strictly, helium belongs to the *s*-block but its positioning in the *p*-block along with other group 18 elements is justified because it has a completely filled valence shell (1*s*2) and as a result, exhibits properties characteristic of other noble gases. The other exception is hydrogen. It has only one *s*-electron and hence can be placed in group 1 (alkali metals). It can also gain an electron to achieve a noble gas arrangement and hence it can behave similar to a group 17 (halogen family) elements. Because it is a special case, we shall place hydrogen separately at the top of the Periodic Table as shown in Fig. 3.2 and Fig. 3.3. We will briefly discuss the salient features of the four types of elements marked in the Periodic Table.

They lose the outermost electron(s) readily to form 1+ ion (in the case of alkali metals) or 2+ ion (in the case of alkaline earth metals). The metallic character and the reactivity increase as we go down the group. Because of high reactivity they are never found pure in nature. The compounds of the *s-*block elements, with the exception of those of lithium and beryllium are predominantly ionic. # **3.6.2 The** *p-***Block Elements** The *p***-Block Elements** comprise those belonging to Group 13 to 18 and these together with the *s-***Block Elements** are called the **Representative Elements or Main Group Elements**. The outermost electronic configuration varies from *ns*2*np*1 to *ns*2*np*<sup>6<\/sup> in each period. At the end of each period is a noble gas element with a closed valence shell *ns*2*np*<sup>6<\/sup> configuration. All the orbitals in the valence shell of the **noble gases** are completely filled by electrons and it is very difficult to alter this stable arrangement by the addition or removal of electrons. The noble gases thus exhibit very low chemical reactivity. Preceding the noble gas family are two chemically important groups of nonmetals. They are the **halogens** (Group 17) and the **chalcogens** (Group 16). These two groups of elements have highly negative electron gain enthalpies and readily add one or two electrons respectively to attain the stable noble gas configuration. The non-metallic character increases as we move from left to right across a period and metallic character increases as we go down the group. # **3.6.3 The** *d-***Block Elements (Transition Elements)** These are the elements of Group 3 to 12 in the centre of the Periodic Table. These are characterised by the filling of inner *d* orbitals by electrons and are therefore referred to as *d-***Block Elements**. These elements have the general outer electronic configuration (*n-*1)*d*1-10*ns*0-2 except for Pd where its electronic configuration is 4d105s0.. They are all metals. They mostly form coloured ions, exhibit variable valence (oxidation states), paramagnetism and oftenly used as catalysts. However, Zn, Cd and Hg which have the electronic configuration, (*n-*1) *d*10*ns*2 do not show most of the properties of transition elements. In a way, transition metals form a bridge between the chemically active metals of *s-*block elements and the less active elements of Groups 13 and 14 and thus take their familiar name **\"Transition Elements\"**. # **3.6.4 The f-Block Elements (Inner-Transition Elements)** The two rows of elements at the bottom of the Periodic Table, called the **Lanthanoids,** Ce(*Z* = 58) \u2013 Lu(*Z* = 71) and **Actinoids**, Th(*Z* = 90) \u2013 Lr (*Z* = 103) are characterised"

These two series of elements are hence called the **Inner-Transition Elements** (*f-***Block Elements**). They are all metals. Within each series, the properties of the elements are quite similar. The chemistry of the early actinoids is more complicated than the corresponding lanthanoids, due to the large number of oxidation states possible for these actinoid elements. Actinoid elements are radioactive. Many of the actinoid elements have been made only in nanogram quantities or even less by nuclear reactions and their chemistry is not fully studied.

The element with *Z* = 120, will be placed in Group 2 (alkaline earth metals), and will have the electronic configuration [Uuo]8*s*2. Classification of Elements and Periodicity in Properties 85 # **3.6.5 Metals, Non-metals and Metalloids** In addition to displaying the classification of elements into *s-***,** *p-***,** *d-*, and *f-***blocks**, Fig. 3.3 shows another broad classification of elements based on their properties. The elements can be divided into **Metals** and **Non-Metals**. Metals comprise more than 78% of all known elements and appear on the left side of the **Periodic Table**. Metals are usually solids at room temperature [mercury is an exception; gallium and caesium also have very low melting points (303K and 302K, respectively)]. Metals usually have high melting and boiling points. They are good conductors of heat and electricity. They are malleable (can be flattened into thin sheets by hammering) and ductile (can be drawn into wires). In contrast, non-metals are located at the top right hand side of the **Periodic Table**. In fact, in a horizontal row, the property of elements change from metallic on the left to non-metallic on the right. Non-metals are usually solids or gases at room temperature with low melting and boiling points (boron and carbon are exceptions). They are poor conductors of heat and electricity. Most nonmetallic solids are brittle and are neither malleable nor ductile. The elements become more metallic as we go down a group; the non-metallic character increases as one goes from left to right across the **Periodic Table**. The change from metallic to non-metallic character is not abrupt as shown by the thick zig-zag line in Fig. 3.3. The elements (e.g., silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium) bordering this line and running diagonally across the **Periodic Table** show properties that are characteristic of both metals and non-metals. These elements are called **Semi-metals** or **Metalloids**. # **Problem 3.4** Considering the atomic number and position in the periodic table, arrange the following elements in the increasing order of metallic character : Si, Be, Mg, Na, P. # **Solution** Metallic character increases down a group and decreases along a period as we move from left to right. Hence the order of increasing metallic character is: P < Si < Be < Mg < Na. # **3.7 PERIODIC TRENDS IN PROPERTIES OF ELEMENTS** There are many observable patterns in the physical and chemical properties of elements as we descend in a group or move across a period in the Periodic Table. For example, within a period, chemical reactivity tends to be high in Group 1 metals, lower in elements towards the middle of the table, and increases to a maximum in the Group 17 non-metals. Likewise within a group of representative metals (say alkali metals) reactivity increases on moving down the group, whereas within a group of non-metals (say halogens), reactivity decreases down the group. But why do the properties of elements follow these trends? And how can we explain periodicity? To answer these questions, we must look into the theories of atomic structure and properties of the atom. In this section we shall discuss the periodic trends in certain physical and chemical properties and try to explain them in terms of number of electrons and energy levels. # **3.7.1 Trends in Physical Properties** There are numerous physical properties of elements such as melting and boiling points, heats of fusion and vaporization, energy of atomization, etc. which show periodic variations. However, we shall discuss the periodic trends with respect to atomic and ionic radii, ionization enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy and electronegativity. #### *(a) Atomic Radius* Unit 3.indd 85 9\/9\/2022 4:36:14 PM You can very well imagine that finding the size of an atom is a lot more complicated than measuring the radius of a ball. Do you know why? Firstly, because the size of an atom (~ 1.2 \u00c5 i.e., 1.2 \u00d7 10\u201310 m in radius) is very small. Secondly, since the electron cloud surrounding the atom does not have a sharp boundary, the determination of the atomic size cannot be precise. In other words, there is no practical way by which the size of an individual atom can be measured. However, an estimate of the atomic size can be made by knowing the distance between the atoms in the combined state. One practical approach to estimate the size of an atom of a non-metallic element is to measure the distance between two atoms when they are bound together by a single bond in a covalent molecule and from this value, the \"**Covalent Radius**\" of the element can be calculated. For example, the bond distance in the chlorine molecule (Cl2) is 198 pm and half this distance (99 pm), is taken as the atomic radius of chlorine. For metals, we define the term \"**Metallic Radius\"** which is taken as half the internuclear distance separating the metal cores in the metallic crystal. For example, the distance between two adjacent copper atoms in solid copper is 256 pm;"
