It is the science not so much of the one hundred elements but of the infinite variety of molecules that may be built from them.*\n\n*Roald Hoffmann*\n\nScience can be viewed as a continuing human effort to systematise knowledge for describing and understanding nature. You have learnt in your previous classes that we come across diverse substances present in nature and changes in them in daily life. Curd formation from milk, formation of vinegar from sugarcane juice on keeping for prolonged time and rusting of iron are some of the examples of changes which we come across many times. For the sake of convenience, science is sub-divided into various disciplines: chemistry, physics, biology, geology, etc. The branch of science that studies the preparation, properties, structure and reactions of material substances is called chemistry.\n\n### **DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMISTRY**\n\nChemistry, as we understand it today, is not a very old discipline. Chemistry was not studied for its own sake, rather it came up as a result of search for two interesting things:\n\n*i. Philosopher's stone (Paras)* which would convert all baser metals e.g., iron and copper into gold.\n\n*ii. 'Elixir of life'* which would grant immortality. People in ancient India, already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of modern science. They applied that knowledge in various walks of life. Chemistry developed mainly in the form of Alchemy and Iatrochemistry during 1300-1600 CE. Modern chemistry took shape in the 18th century Europe, after a few centuries of alchemical traditions which were introduced in Europe by the Arabs.\n\n2 chemistry\n\nOther cultures – especially the Chinese and the Indian – had their own alchemical traditions. These included much knowledge of chemical processes and techniques.\n\nIn ancient India, chemistry was called *Rasayan Shastra, Rastantra, Ras Kriya* or *Rasvidya*. It included metallurgy, medicine, manufacture of cosmetics, glass, dyes, etc. Systematic excavations at Mohenjodaro in Sindh and Harappa in Punjab prove that the story of development of chemistry in India is very old. Archaeological findings show that baked bricks were used in construction work. It shows the mass production of pottery, which can be regarded as the earliest chemical process, in which materials were mixed, moulded and subjected to heat by using fire to achieve desirable qualities. Remains of glazed pottery have been found in Mohenjodaro. Gypsum cement has been used in the construction work. It contains lime, sand and traces of CaCO3. Harappans made faience, a sort of glass which was used in ornaments. They melted and forged a variety of objects from metals, such as lead, silver, gold and copper. They improved the hardness of copper for making artefacts by using tin and arsenic. A number of glass objects were found in Maski in South India (1000–900 BCE), and Hastinapur and Taxila in North India (1000–200 BCE). Glass and glazes were coloured by addition of colouring agents like metal oxides.\n\nCopper metallurgy in India dates back to the beginning of chalcolithic cultures in the subcontinent. There are much archeological evidences to support the view that technologies for extraction of copper and iron were developed indigenously.\n\nAccording to *Rigveda,* tanning of leather and dying of cotton were practised during 1000–400 BCE. The golden gloss of the black polished ware of northen India could not be replicated and is still a chemical mystery. These wares indicate the mastery with which kiln temperatures could be controlled. Kautilya's *Arthashastra* describes the production of salt from sea.\n\nA vast number of statements and material described in the ancient Vedic literature can be shown to agree with modern scientific findings. Copper utensils, iron, gold, silver ornaments and terracotta discs and painted grey pottery have been found in many archaeological sites in north India. *Sushruta Samhita* explains the importance of Alkalies. The *Charaka Samhita* mentions ancient indians who knew how to prepare sulphuric acid, nitric acid and oxides of copper, tin and zinc; the sulphates of copper, zinc and iron and the carbonates of lead and iron.\n\n*Rasopanishada* describes the preparation of gunpowder mixture. Tamil texts also describe the preparation of fireworks using sulphur, charcoal, saltpetre (i.e., potassium nitrate), mercury, camphor, etc.\n\nNagarjuna was a great Indian scientist. He was a reputed chemist, an alchemist and a metallurgist. His work *Rasratnakar* deals with the formulation of mercury compounds. He has also discussed methods for the extraction of metals, like gold, silver, tin and copper. A book, *Rsarnavam*, appeared around 800 CE. It discusses the uses of various furnaces, ovens and crucibles for different purposes. It describes methods by which metals could be identified by flame colour.\n\n*Chakrapani* discovered mercury sulphide. The credit for inventing soap also goes to him. He used mustard oil and some alkalies as ingredients for making soap. Indians began making soaps in the 18th century CE. Oil of *Eranda* and seeds of *Mahua* plant and calcium carbonate were used for making soap.\n\nThe paintings found on the walls of Ajanta and Ellora, which look fresh even after ages, testify to a high level of science achieved in ancient India. Varähmihir's *Brihat Samhita* is a sort of encyclopaedia, which was composed in the sixth century CE. It informs about the preparation of glutinous material to be applied on walls and roofs of houses and temples. It was prepared entirely from extracts of various plants, fruits, seeds and barks, which were concentrated by boiling, and then, treated with various resins. It will be interesting to test such materials scientifically and assess them for use.\n\nUnit 1.indd 2 9/9/2022 4:27:29 PM\n\n#### Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry 3\n\nA number of classical texts, like *Atharvaveda* (1000 BCE) mention some dye stuff, the material used were turmeric, *madder*, sunflower, orpiment, cochineal and lac. Some other substances having tinting property were *kamplcica, pattanga* and *jatuka*.\n\nVarähmihir's *Brihat Samhita* gives references to perfumes and cosmetics. Recipes for hair dying were made from plants, like indigo and minerals like iron power, black iron or steel and acidic extracts of sour rice gruel. *Gandhayukli* describes recipes for making scents, mouth perfumes, bath powders, incense and talcum power.\n\nPaper was known to India in the 17th century as account of Chinese traveller I-tsing describes. Excavations at Taxila indicate that ink was used in India from the fourth century. Colours of ink were made from chalk, red lead and minimum.\n\nIt seems that the process of fermentation was well-known to Indians*.* Vedas and Kautilya's *Arthashastra* mention about many types of liquors. *Charaka Samhita* also mentions ingredients, such as barks of plants, stem, flowers, leaves, woods, cereals, fruits and sugarcane for making *Asavas.*\n\nThe concept that matter is ultimately made of indivisible building blocks, appeared in India a few centuries BCE as a part of philosophical speculations. Acharya Kanda, born in 600 BCE, originally known by the name Kashyap, was the first proponent of the 'atomic theory'. He formulated the theory of very small indivisible particles, which he named '*Paramãnu*' (comparable to atoms). He authored the text *Vaiseshika Sutras*. According to him, all substances are aggregated form of smaller units called atoms (*Paramãnu*), which are eternal, indestructible, spherical, suprasensible and in motion in the original state. He explained that this individual entity cannot be sensed through any human organ. Kanda added that there are varieties of atoms that are as different as the different classes of substances. He said these (*Paramãnu*) could form pairs or triplets, among other combinations and unseen forces cause interaction between them. He conceptualised this theory around 2500 years before John Dalton (1766-1844).\n\n*Charaka Samhita* is the oldest Ayurvedic epic of India. It describes the treatment of diseases. The concept of reduction of particle size of metals is clearly discussed in *Charaka Samhita*. Extreme reduction of particle size is termed as nanotechnology. *Charaka Samhita*  describes the use of *bhasma* of metals in the treatment of ailments. Now-a-days, it has been proved that *bhasmas* have nanoparticles of metals.\n\nAfter the decline of alchemy, Iatrochemistry reached a steady state, but it too declined due to the introduction and practise of western medicinal system in the 20th century. During this period of stagnation, pharmaceutical industry based on Ayurveda continued to exist, but it too declined gradually. It took about 100-150 years for Indians to learn and adopt new techniques. During this time, foreign products poured in. As a result, indigenous traditional techniques gradually declined. Modern science appeared in Indian scene in the later part of the nineteenth century. By the mid-nineteenth century, European scientists started coming to India and modern chemistry started growing.\n\nFrom the above discussion, you have learnt that chemistry deals with the composition, structure, properties and interection of matter and is of much use to human beings in daily life. These aspects can be best described and understood in terms of basic constituents of matter that are **atoms** and **molecules**. That is why, chemistry is also called the science of atoms and molecules. Can we see, weigh and perceive these entities (atoms and molecules)? Is it possible to count the number of atoms and molecules in a given mass of matter and have a quantitative relationship between the mass and the number of these particles? We will get the answer of some of these questions in this Unit. We will further describe how physical properties of matter can be quantitatively described using numerical values with suitable units.\n\nUnit 1.indd 3 9/9/2022 4:27:29 PM\n\n### **1.1 IMPORTANCE OF CHEMISTRY**\n\nChemistry plays a central role in science and is often intertwined with other branches of science.\n\nPrinciples of chemistry are applicable in diverse areas, such as weather patterns, functioning of brain and operation of a computer, production in chemical industries, manufacturing fertilisers, alkalis, acids, salts, dyes, polymers, drugs, soaps, detergents, metals, alloys, etc., including new material.\n\nChemistry contributes in a big way to the national economy. It also plays an important role in meeting human needs for food, healthcare products and other material aimed at improving the quality of life. This is exemplified by the large-scale production of a variety of fertilisers, improved variety of pesticides and insecticides. Chemistry provides methods for the isolation of lifesaving drugs from natural sources and makes possible synthesis of such drugs. Some of these drugs are **cisplatin** and **taxol**, which are effective in cancer therapy. The drug AZT (Azidothymidine) is used for helping AIDS patients.\n\nChemistry contributes to a large extent in the development and growth of a nation. With a better understanding of chemical principles it has now become possible to design and synthesise new material having specific magnetic, electric and optical properties. This has lead to the production of superconducting ceramics, conducting polymers, optical fibres, etc. Chemistry has helped in establishing industries which manufacture utility goods, like acids, alkalies, dyes, polymesr metals, etc. These industries contribute in a big way to the economy of a nation and generate employment.\n\nIn recent years, chemistry has helped in dealing with some of the pressing aspects of environmental degradation with a fair degree of success. Safer alternatives to environmentally hazardous refrigerants, like CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), responsible for ozone depletion in the stratosphere, have been successfully synthesised. However, many big environmental problems continue to be matters of grave concern to the chemists. One such problem is the management of the Green House gases, like methane, carbon dioxide, etc. Understanding of biochemical processes, use of enzymes for large-scale production of chemicals and synthesis of new exotic material are some of the intellectual challenges for the future generation of chemists. A developing country, like India, needs talented and creative chemists for accepting such challenges. To be a good chemist and to accept such challanges, one needs to understand the basic concepts of chemistry, which begin with the concept of matter. Let us start with the nature of matter.\n\n#### **1.2 Nature of Matter**\n\nYou are already familiar with the term **matter** from your earlier classes. Anything which has mass and occupies space is called **matter**. Everything around us, for example, book, pen, pencil, water, air, all living beings, etc., are composed of matter. You know that they have mass and they occupy space. Let us recall the characteristics of the states of matter, which you learnt in your previous classes.\n\n#### **1.2.1 States of Matter**\n\nYou are aware that matter can exist in three physical states *viz.* **solid**, **liquid** and **gas**. The constituent particles of matter in these three states can be represented as shown in Fig. 1.1.\n\nParticles are held very close to each other in **solids** in an orderly fashion and there is not much freedom of movement. In **liquids**, the particles are close to each other but they can move around. However, in **gases**, the particles are far apart as compared to those present in solid or liquid states and their movement is easy and fast. Because of such arrangement of particles, different states of matter exhibit the following characteristics:\n\n- (i) Solids have *definite volume* and *definite shape*.\n- (ii) Liquids have *definite volume* but *do not* have *definite shape*. They take the shape of the container in which they are placed.\n\nUnit 1.indd 4 9/9/2022 4:27:29 PM\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n*Fig. 1.2 Classification of matter Fig. 1.1 Arrangement of particles in solid, liquid and gaseous state*\n\n(iii) Gases have *neither definite volume nor definite shape*. They completely occupy the space in the container in which they are placed.\n\nThese three states of matter are interconvertible by changing the conditions of temperature and pressure.\n\nSolid liquid Gas\n\nOn heating, a solid usually changes to a liquid, and the liquid on further heating changes to gas (or vapour). In the reverse process, a gas on cooling liquifies to the liquid and the liquid on further cooling freezes to the solid.\n\n#### **1.2.2. Classification of Matter**\n\nIn Class IX (Chapter 2), you have learnt that at the macroscopic or bulk level, matter can be classified as **mixture** or **pure substance**. These can be further sub-divided as shown in Fig. 1.2.\n\nWhen all constituent particles of a substance are same in chemical nature, it is said to be a pure substance. A mixture contains many types of particles.\n\n**A mixture** contains particles of two or more pure substances which may be present in it in any ratio. Hence, their composition is variable. Pure substances forming mixture are called its components. Many of the substances present around you are **mixtures**. For example, sugar solution in water, air, tea, etc., are all mixtures. A mixture may be **homogeneous** or **heterogeneous**. In a **homogeneous mixture**, the components\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_11.jpeg)\n\ncompletely mix with each other. This means particles of components of the mixture are uniformly distributed throughout the bulk of the mixture and its composition is uniform throughout. Sugar solution and air are the examples of homogeneous mixtures. In contrast to this, in a **heterogeneous mixture**, the composition is not uniform throughout and sometimes different components are visible. For example, mixtures of salt and sugar, grains and pulses along with some dirt (often stone pieces), are heterogeneous mixtures. You can think of many more examples of mixtures which you come across in the daily life. It is worthwhile to mention here that the components of a mixture can be separated by using physical methods, such as simple hand-picking, filtration, crystallisation, distillation, etc.\n\n**Pure substances** have characteristics different from mixtures. Constituent particles of pure substances have fixed composition. Copper, silver, gold, water and glucose are some examples of pure substances. Glucose contains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in a fixed ratio and its particles are of same composition. Hence, like all other pure substances, glucose has a fixed composition. Also, its constituents—carbon, hydrogen and oxygen—cannot be separated by simple physical methods.\n\nPure substances can further be classified into **elements** and **compounds**. Particles of an **element** consist of only one type of atoms. These particles may exist as **atoms** or **molecules**. You may be familiar with atoms\n\nUnit 1.indd 5 9/9/2022 4:27:30 PM\n\n6 chemistry\n\nand molecules from the previous classes; however, you will be studying about them in detail in Unit 2. Sodium, copper, silver, hydrogen, oxygen, etc., are some examples of elements. Their all atoms are of one type. However, the atoms of different elements are different in nature. Some elements, such as sodium or copper, contain atoms as their constituent particles, whereas, in some others, the constituent particles are molecules which are formed by two or more atoms. For example, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen gases consist of molecules, in which two atoms combine to give their respective molecules. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.3.\n\n![](_page_5_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\n*Fig. 1.3 A representation of atoms and molecules*\n\nWhen two or more atoms of different elements combine together in a definite ratio, the molecule of a **compound** is obtained. Moreover, the constituents of a compound cannot be separated into simpler substances by physical methods. They can be separated by chemical methods. Examples of some compounds are water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, sugar, etc. The molecules of water and carbon dioxide are represented in Fig. 1.4.\n\nNote that a water molecule comprises two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Similarly, a molecule of carbon dioxide contains two oxygen atoms combined with one carbon atom. Thus, the atoms of different\n\n![](_page_5_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\n*Fig. 1.4 A depiction of molecules of water and carbon dioxide*\n\nelements are present in a compound in a fixed and definite ratio and this ratio is characteristic of a particular compound. Also, the properties of a compound are different from those of its constituent elements. For example, hydrogen and oxygen are gases, whereas, the compound formed by their combination i.e., water is a liquid. It is interesting to note that hydrogen burns with a pop sound and oxygen is a supporter of combustion, but water is used as a fire extinguisher.\n\n# **1.3 Properties of Matter and their Measurement**\n\n#### **1.3.1 Physical and chemical properties**\n\nEvery substance has unique or characteristic properties. These properties can be classified into two categories — **physical properties,** such as colour, odour, melting point, boiling point, density, etc., and **chemical properties,** like composition, combustibility, ractivity with acids and bases, etc.\n\n**Physical properties** can be measured or observed without changing the identity or the composition of the substance. The measurement or observation of **chemical properties** requires a chemical change to occur. Measurement of physical properties does not require occurance of a chemical change. The examples of chemical properties are characteristic reactions of different substances; these include acidity or basicity, combustibility, etc. Chemists describe, interpret and predict the behaviour of substances on the basis of knowledge of their physical and chemical properties, which are determined by careful measurement and experimentation. In the following section, we\n\nUnit 1.indd 6 9/9/2022 4:27:30 PM\n\nwill learn about the measurement of physical properties.\n\n#### **1.3.2 Measurement of physical properties**\n\nQuantitative measurement of properties is reaquired for scientific investigation. Many properties of matter, such as length, area, volume, etc., are quantitative in nature. Any quantitative observation or measurement is represented by a number followed by units in which it is measured. For example, length of a room can be represented as 6 m; here, 6 is the number and m denotes metre, the unit in which the length is measured.\n\nEarlier, two different systems of measurement, i.e., the **English System**  and the **Metric System** were being used in different parts of the world. The metric system, which originated in France in late eighteenth century, was more convenient as it was based on the decimal system. Late, need of a common standard system was felt by the scientific community. Such a system was established in 1960 and is discussed in detail below.\n\n#### **1.3.3 The International System of Units (SI)**\n\nThe International System of Units (in French *Le Systeme International d'Unités*  — abbreviated as SI) was established by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM from *Conference Generale des Poids et Measures*). The CGPM is an inter-\n\n#### **Maintaining the National Standards of Measurement**\n\nThe system of units, including unit definitions, keeps on changing with time. Whenever the accuracy of measurement of a particular unit was enhanced substantially by adopting new principles, member nations of metre treaty (signed in 1875), agreed to change the formal definition of that unit. Each modern industrialised country, including India, has a National Metrology Institute (NMI), which maintains standards of measurements. This responsibility has been given to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi. This laboratory establishes experiments to realise the *base units* and *derived units* of measurement and maintains National Standards of Measurement. These standards are periodically inter-compared with standards maintained at other National Metrology Institutes in the world, as well as those, established at the International Bureau of Standards in Paris.\n\ngovernmental treaty organisation created by a diplomatic treaty known as Metre Convention, which was signed in Paris in 1875.\n\n**The SI system has seven** *base units* and they are listed in Table 1.1. These units pertain to the seven fundamental scientific quantities. The other physical quantities, such as speed, volume, density, etc., can be derived from these quantities.\n\n| Base Physical `<br>`Quantity    | Symbol for `<br>`Quantity | Name of `<br>`SI Unit | Symbol for `<br>`SI Unit |\n| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Length                            | l                           | metre                   | m                          |\n| Mass                              | m                           | kilogram                | kg                         |\n| Time                              | t                           | second                  | s                          |\n| Electric current                  | I                           | ampere                  | A                          |\n| Thermodynamic `<br>`temperature | T                           | kelvin                  | K                          |\n| Amount of `<br>`substance       | n `<br>`I                 | mole `<br>`candela    | mol                        |\n| Luminous `<br>`intensity        | v                           |                         | cd                         |\n\n# **Table 1.1 Base Physical Quantities and their Units**\n\nUnit 1.indd 7 9/9/2022 4:27:30 PM\n\nThe definitions of the SI base units are given in Table 1.2.\n\nThe SI system allows the use of prefixes to indicate the multiples or submultiples of a unit. These prefixes are listed in Table 1.3.\n\nLet us now quickly go through some of the quantities which you will be often using in this book.\n\n| Unit of length                                    | metre    | The metre, symbol m is the SI unit of length.

        "summary": "Chemistry is the science of molecules, their transformations, and the study of material substances. Its development spans from ancient Indian contributions in metallurgy, medicine, and atomic theory by Acharya Kanda, through alchemy, to modern chemistry in the 18th century. Chemistry plays a crucial role in the national economy, addressing human needs in food, healthcare, and the development of new materials and technologies. It also tackles environmental challenges, such as finding alternatives to hazardous refrigerants. Fundamental concepts include matter, defined as anything with mass and occupying space, which exists in solid, liquid, and gaseous states. Matter is further classified into mixtures, which have variable compositions, and pure substances, which have fixed compositions. Pure substances are divided into elements, composed of one type of atom, and compounds, formed by two or more different atoms in a definite ratio. Properties of matter are either physical, observable without chemical change, or chemical, requiring a chemical transformation. Scientific measurements rely on the International System of Units (SI), comprising seven base units for fundamental quantities.",

The chemical energy may also be used to do mechanical work when a fuel burns in an engine or to provide electrical energy through a galvanic cell like dry cell. Thus, various forms of energy are interrelated and under certain conditions, these may be transformed from one form into another. The study of these energy transformations forms the subject matter of thermodynamics. The laws of thermodynamics deal with energy changes of macroscopic systems involving a large number of molecules rather than microscopic systems containing a few molecules. Thermodynamics is not concerned about how and at what rate these energy transformations are carried out, but is based on initial and final states of a system undergoing the change. Laws of thermodynamics apply only when a system is in equilibrium or moves from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium state. Macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature do not change with time for a system in equilibrium state. In this unit, we would like to answer some of the important questions through thermodynamics, like:\n\n*How do we determine the energy changes involved in a chemical reaction/process? Will it occur or not?*\n\n*What drives a chemical reaction/process?*\n\n*To what extent do the chemical reactions proceed?*\n\nUnit 5.indd 136 9/12/2022 11:53:33 AM\n\n# **5.1 Thermodynamic terms**\n\nWe are interested in chemical reactions and the energy changes accompanying them. For this we need to know certain thermodynamic terms. These are discussed below.\n\n# **5.1.1 The System and the Surroundings**\n\nA **system** in thermodynamics refers to that part of universe in which observations are made and remaining universe constitutes the **surroundings.** The surroundings include everything other than the system. System and the surroundings together constitute the universe.\n\nThe universe = The system + The surroundings\n\nHowever, the entire universe other than the system is not affected by the changes taking place in the system. Therefore, for all practical purposes, the surroundings are that portion of the remaining universe which can interact with the system. Usually, the region of space in the neighbourhood of the system constitutes its surroundings.\n\nFor example, if we are studying the reaction between two substances A and B kept in a beaker, the beaker containing the reaction mixture is the system and the room where the beaker is kept is the surroundings (Fig. 5.1).\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\n*Fig. 5.1 System and the surroundings*\n\nNote that the system may be defined by physical boundaries, like beaker or test tube, or the system may simply be defined by a set of Cartesian coordinates specifying a particular volume in space. It is necessary to think of the system as separated from the surroundings by some sort of wall which may be real or imaginary. The wall that separates the system from the surroundings is called **boundary**. This is designed to allow us to control and keep track of all movements of matter and energy in or out of the system.\n\n### **5.1.2 Types of the System**\n\nWe, further classify the systems according to the movements of matter and energy in or out of the system.\n\n# *1. Open System*\n\nIn an open system, there is exchange of energy and matter between system and surroundings [Fig. 5.2 (a)]. The presence of reactants in an open beaker is an example of an open system\\*. Here the boundary is an imaginary surface enclosing the beaker and reactants.\n\n# *2. Closed System*\n\nIn a closed system, there is no exchange of matter, but exchange of energy is possible between system and the surroundings [Fig. 5.2 (b)]. The presence of reactants in a closed vessel made of conducting material e.g., copper or steel is an example of a closed system.\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_18.jpeg)\n\n*\\* We could have chosen only the reactants as system then walls of the beakers will act as boundary.*\n\nUnit 5.indd 137 9/12/2022 11:53:34 AM\n\n#### *3. Isolated System*\n\nIn an isolated system, there is no exchange of energy or matter between the system and the surroundings [Fig. 5.2 (c)]. The presence of reactants in a thermos flask or any other closed insulated vessel is an example of an isolated system.\n\n#### **5.1.3 The State of the System**\n\nThe system must be described in order to make any useful calculations by specifying quantitatively each of the properties such as its pressure (*p*), volume (*V*), and temperature (*T* ) as well as the composition of the system. We need to describe the system by specifying it before and after the change. You would recall from your Physics course that the state of a system in mechanics is completely specified at a given instant of time, by the position and velocity of each mass point of the system. In thermodynamics, a different and much simpler concept of the state of a system is introduced. It does not need detailed knowledge of motion of each particle because, we deal with average measurable properties of the system. We specify the state of the system by **state functions** or **state variables**.\n\nThe **state** of a thermodynamic system is described by its measurable or macroscopic (bulk) properties. We can describe the state of a gas by quoting its pressure (*p*), volume (*V*), temperature (*T* ), amount (*n*) etc. Variables like *p*, *V*, *T* are called **state variables** or **state functions** because their values depend only on the state of the system and not on how it is reached. In order to completely define the state of a system it is not necessary to define all the properties of the system; as only a certain number of properties can be varied independently. This number depends on the nature of the system. Once these minimum number of macroscopic properties are fixed, others automatically have definite values.\n\nThe state of the surroundings can never be completely specified; fortunately it is not necessary to do so.\n\n# **5.1.4 The Internal Energy as a State Function**\n\nWhen we talk about our chemical system losing or gaining energy, we need to introduce a quantity which represents the total energy of the system. It may be chemical, electrical, mechanical or any other type of energy you may think of, the sum of all these is the energy of the system. In thermodynamics, we call it the internal energy, *U* of the system, which may change, when\n\n- • heat passes into or out of the system,\n- • work is done on or by the system,\n- • matter enters or leaves the system.\n\nThese systems are classified accordingly as you have already studied in section 5.1.2.\n\n#### *(a) Work*\n\nLet us first examine a change in internal energy by doing work. We take a system containing some quantity of water in a thermos flask or in an insulated beaker. This would not allow exchange of heat between the system and surroundings through its boundary and we call this type of system as **adiabatic**. The manner in which the state of such a system may be changed will be called adiabatic process. Adiabatic process is a process in which there is no transfer of heat between the system and surroundings. Here, the wall separating the system and the surroundings is called the adiabatic wall (Fig. 5.3).\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_16.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_17.jpeg)\n\nLet us bring the change in the internal energy of the system by doing some work on it. Let us call the initial state of the system as state A and its temperature as *T*A. Let the internal energy of the system in state A be called *U*A. We can change the state of the system in two different ways.\n\nUnit 5.indd 138 9/12/2022 11:53:36 AM\n\n#### THERMODYNAMICS 139\n\n*One way:* We do some mechanical work, say 1 kJ, by rotating a set of small paddles and thereby churning water. Let the new state be called B state and its temperature, as *T*B. It is found that *T*B > *T*A and the change in temperature, ∆*T* = *T*B–*T*A. Let the internal energy of the system in state B be *U*B and the change in internal energy, ∆*U* =*U*B– *U*A.\n\n*Second way:* We now do an equal amount (i.e., 1kJ) electrical work with the help of an immersion rod and note down the temperature change. We find that the change in temperature is same as in the earlier case, say, *T*B – *T*A.\n\nIn fact, the experiments in the above manner were done by J. P. Joule between 1840–50 and he was able to show that a given amount of work done on the system, no matter how it was done (irrespective of path) produced the same change of state, as measured by the change in the temperature of the system.\n\nSo, it seems appropriate to define a quantity, the internal energy *U*, whose value is characteristic of the state of a system, whereby the adiabatic work, wad required to bring about a change of state is equal to the difference between the value of *U* in one state and that in another state, ∆*U i.e.,*\n\n∆*U =U*2 *–U*1*=* wad\n\nTherefore, internal energy, *U*, of the system is a state function.\n\nBy conventions of IUPAC in chemical thermodynamics. The positive sign expresses that wad is positive when work is done **on** the system and the internal energy of system increases. Similarly, if the work is done **by** the system, wad will be negative because internal energy of the system decreases.\n\nCan you name some other familiar state functions? Some of other familiar state functions are *V*, *p*, and *T*. For example, if we bring a change in temperature of the system from 25°C to 35°C, the change in temperature is 35°C–25°C = +10°C, whether we go straight up to 35°C or we cool the system for a few degrees, then take the system to the final temperature. Thus, *T* is a state function and the change in temperature is independent of the route taken. Volume of water in a pond, for example, is a state function, because change in volume of its water is independent of the route by which water is filled in the pond, either by rain or by tubewell or by both.\n\n#### *(b) Heat*\n\nWe can also change the internal energy of a system by transfer of heat from the surroundings to the system or vice-versa without expenditure of work. This exchange of energy, which is a result of temperature difference is called heat, *q*. Let us consider bringing about the same change in temperature (the same initial and final states as before in section 5.1.4 (a) by transfer of heat through thermally conducting walls instead of adiabatic walls (Fig. 5.4).\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_12.jpeg)\n\n*Fig. 5.4 A system which allows heat transfer through its boundary.*\n\nWe take water at temperature, *T*A in a container having thermally conducting walls, say made up of copper and enclose it in a huge heat reservoir at temperature, *T*B. The heat absorbed by the system (water), *q* can be measured in terms of temperature difference, *T*B – *T*A. In this case change in internal energy, ∆*U* = *q*, when no work is done at constant volume.\n\n*By conventions of IUPAC in chemical thermodynamics. The q is positive, when heat is transferred from the surroundings to the system and the internal energy of the system increases and q is negative when heat is transferred from system to the surroundings resulting in decrease of the internal energy of the system.*\n\nUnit 5.indd 139 9/12/2022 11:53:37 AM\n\n*`<sup>`\\*`</sup>` Earlier negative sign was assigned when the work is done on the system and positive sign when the work is done by the system. This is still followed in physics books, although IUPAC has recommended the use of new sign convention.*\n\n# *(c) The general case*\n\nLet us consider the general case in which a change of state is brought about both by doing work and by transfer of heat. We write change in internal energy for this case as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta U = q \\,\\,\\,+\\,\\,\\,\\text{w} \\tag{5.1}\n$$\n\nFor a given change in state, *q* and w can vary depending on how the change is carried out. However, *q* +w = ∆*U* will depend only on initial and final state. It will be independent of the way the change is carried out. If there is no transfer of energy as heat or as work (isolated system) i.e., if w = 0 and *q* = 0, then ∆ *U* = 0.\n\nThe equation 5.1 i.e., ∆*U* = *q* + w is mathematical statement of the **first law of thermodynamics**, which states that\n\n# *The energy of an isolated system is constant.*\n\nIt is commonly stated as the law of conservation of energy i.e., energy can neither be created nor be destroyed.\n\n**Note:** There is considerable difference between the character of the thermodynamic property energy and that of a mechanical property such as volume. We can specify an unambiguous (absolute) value for volume of a system in a particular state, but not the absolute value of the internal energy. However, we can measure only the changes in the internal energy, ∆*U* of the system.\n\n## **Problem 5.1**\n\nExpress the change in internal energy of a system when\n\n- (i) No heat is absorbed by the system from the surroundings, but work (w) is done on the system. What type of wall does the system have ?\n- (ii) No work is done on the system, but *q* amount of heat is taken out from the system and given to the surroundings. What type of wall does the system have?\n- (iii) w amount of work is done by the system and *q* amount of heat is supplied to the system. What type of system would it be?\n\n#### **Solution**\n\n- (i) ∆ *U* = w ad, wall is adiabatic\n- (ii) ∆ *U* = *q*, thermally conducting walls\n- (iii) ∆ *U* = *q* w, closed system.\n\n#### **5.2 Applications**\n\nMany chemical reactions involve the generation of gases capable of doing mechanical work or the generation of heat. It is important for us to quantify these changes and relate them to the changes in the internal energy. Let us see how!\n",

        "summary": "Thermodynamics studies energy transformations in macroscopic systems, focusing on initial and final equilibrium states. A system is the observed part of the universe, with surroundings being everything else. Systems are categorized as open (exchanging energy and matter), closed (exchanging only energy), or isolated (exchanging neither). The state of a system is defined by state functions like pressure, volume, and temperature, which depend solely on its current condition. Internal energy (U) represents the system's total energy and changes through work (w) done on or by the system, or heat (q) transferred to or from it. The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy (∆U) equals the sum of heat and work (∆U = q + w). This law signifies the conservation of energy, meaning the energy of an isolated system remains constant. Only changes in internal energy, not absolute values, can be measured.",

        "page_content": "DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMISTRY** Chemistry, as we understand it today, is not a very old discipline. Chemistry was not studied for its own sake, rather it came up as a result of search for two interesting things: *i. Philosopher's stone (Paras)* which would convert all baser metals e.g., iron and copper into gold. *ii. 'Elixir of life'* which would grant immortality. People in ancient India, already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of modern science. They applied that knowledge in various walks of life. Chemistry developed mainly in the form of Alchemy and Iatrochemistry during 1300-1600 CE. Modern chemistry took shape in the 18th century Europe, after a few centuries of alchemical traditions which were introduced in Europe by the Arabs. 2 chemistry Other cultures – especially the Chinese and the Indian – had their own alchemical traditions. These included much knowledge of chemical processes and techniques. In ancient India, chemistry was called *Rasayan Shastra, Rastantra, Ras Kriya* or *Rasvidya*. It included metallurgy, medicine, manufacture of cosmetics, glass, dyes, etc. Systematic excavations at Mohenjodaro in Sindh and Harappa in Punjab prove that the story of development of chemistry in India is very old. Archaeological findings show that baked bricks were used in construction work. It shows the mass production of pottery, which can be regarded as the earliest chemical process, in which materials were mixed, moulded and subjected to heat by using fire to achieve desirable qualities. Remains of glazed pottery have been found in Mohenjodaro. Gypsum cement has been used in the construction work. It contains lime, sand and traces of CaCO3. Harappans made faience, a sort of glass which was used in ornaments. They melted and forged a variety of objects from metals, such as lead, silver, gold and copper. They improved the hardness of copper for making artefacts by using tin and arsenic. A number of glass objects were found in Maski in South India (1000–900 BCE), and Hastinapur and Taxila in North India (1000–200 BCE). Glass and glazes were coloured by addition of colouring agents like metal oxides. Copper metallurgy in India dates back to the beginning of chalcolithic cultures in the subcontinent. There are much archeological evidences to support the view that technologies for extraction of copper and iron were developed indigenously. According to *Rigveda,* tanning of leather and dying of cotton were practised during 1000–400 BCE. The golden gloss of the black polished ware of northen India could not be replicated and is still a chemical mystery. These wares indicate the mastery with which kiln temperatures could be controlled. Kautilya's *Arthashastra* describes the production of salt from sea. A vast number of statements and material described in the ancient Vedic literature can be shown to agree with modern scientific findings. Copper utensils, iron, gold, silver ornaments and terracotta discs and painted grey pottery have been found in many archaeological sites in north India. *Sushruta Samhita* explains the importance of Alkalies. The *Charaka Samhita* mentions ancient indians who knew how to prepare sulphuric acid, nitric acid and oxides of copper, tin and zinc; the sulphates of copper, zinc and iron and the carbonates of lead and iron. *Rasopanishada* describes the preparation of gunpowder mixture. Tamil texts also describe the preparation of fireworks using sulphur, charcoal, saltpetre (i.e., potassium nitrate), mercury, camphor, etc. Nagarjuna was a great Indian scientist. He was a reputed chemist, an alchemist and a metallurgist. His work *Rasratnakar* deals with the formulation of mercury compounds. He has also discussed methods for the extraction of metals, like gold, silver, tin and copper. A book, *Rsarnavam*, appeared around 800 CE. It discusses the uses of various furnaces, ovens and crucibles for different purposes. It describes methods by which metals could be identified by flame colour. *Chakrapani* discovered mercury sulphide. The credit for inventing soap also goes to him. He used mustard oil and some alkalies as ingredients for making soap. Indians began making soaps in the 18th century CE. Oil of *Eranda* and seeds of *Mahua* plant and calcium carbonate were used for making soap. The paintings found on the walls of Ajanta and Ellora, which look fresh even after ages, testify to a high",

        "page_content": "level of science achieved in ancient India. Varähmihir's *Brihat Samhita* is a sort of encyclopaedia, which was composed in the sixth century CE. It informs about the preparation of glutinous material to be applied on walls and roofs of houses and temples. It was prepared entirely from extracts of various plants, fruits, seeds and barks, which were concentrated by boiling, and then, treated with various resins. It will be interesting to test such materials scientifically and assess them for use. Unit 1.indd 2 9/9/2022 4:27:29 PM #### Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry 3 A number of classical texts, like *Atharvaveda* (1000 BCE) mention some dye stuff, the material used were turmeric, *madder*, sunflower, orpiment, cochineal and lac. Some other substances having tinting property were *kamplcica, pattanga* and *jatuka*. Varähmihir's *Brihat Samhita* gives references to perfumes and cosmetics. Recipes for hair dying were made from plants, like indigo and minerals like iron power, black iron or steel and acidic extracts of sour rice gruel. *Gandhayukli* describes recipes for making scents, mouth perfumes, bath powders, incense and talcum power. Paper was known to India in the 17th century as account of Chinese traveller I-tsing describes. Excavations at Taxila indicate that ink was used in India from the fourth century. Colours of ink were made from chalk, red lead and minimum. It seems that the process of fermentation was well-known to Indians*.* Vedas and Kautilya's *Arthashastra* mention about many types of liquors. *Charaka Samhita* also mentions ingredients, such as barks of plants, stem, flowers, leaves, woods, cereals, fruits and sugarcane for making *Asavas.* The concept that matter is ultimately made of indivisible building blocks, appeared in India a few centuries BCE as a part of philosophical speculations. Acharya Kanda, born in 600 BCE, originally known by the name Kashyap, was the first proponent of the 'atomic theory'. He formulated the theory of very small indivisible particles, which he named '*Paramãnu*' (comparable to atoms). He authored the text *Vaiseshika Sutras*. According to him, all substances are aggregated form of smaller units called atoms (*Paramãnu*), which are eternal, indestructible, spherical, suprasensible and in motion in the original state. He explained that this individual entity cannot be sensed through any human organ. Kanda added that there are varieties of atoms that are as different as the different classes of substances. He said these (*Paramãnu*) could form pairs or triplets, among other combinations and unseen forces cause interaction between them. He conceptualised this theory around 2500 years before John Dalton (1766-1844). *Charaka Samhita* is the oldest Ayurvedic epic of India. It describes the treatment of diseases. The concept of reduction of particle size of metals is clearly discussed in *Charaka Samhita*. Extreme reduction of particle size is termed as nanotechnology. *Charaka Samhita* describes the use of *bhasma* of metals in the treatment of ailments. Now-a-days, it has been proved that *bhasmas* have nanoparticles of metals. After the decline of alchemy, Iatrochemistry reached a steady state, but it too declined due to the introduction and practise of western medicinal system in the 20th century. During this period of stagnation, pharmaceutical industry based on Ayurveda continued to exist, but it too declined gradually. It took about 100-150 years for Indians to learn and adopt new techniques. During this time, foreign products poured in. As a result, indigenous traditional techniques gradually declined. Modern science appeared in Indian scene in the later part of the nineteenth century. By the mid-nineteenth century, European scientists started coming to India and modern chemistry started growing. From the above discussion, you have learnt that chemistry deals with the composition, structure, properties and interection of matter and is of much use to human beings in daily life. These aspects can be best described and understood in terms of basic constituents of matter that are **atoms** and **molecules**. That is why, chemistry is also called the science of atoms and molecules. Can we see, weigh and perceive these entities (atoms and molecules)? Is it possible to count the number of atoms and molecules in a given mass of matter and have a quantitative relationship between the mass and the number of these particles? We will get the answer",

        "page_content": "1.1 IMPORTANCE OF CHEMISTRY**\n\nChemistry plays a central role in science and is often intertwined with other branches of science.\n\nPrinciples of chemistry are applicable in diverse areas, such as weather patterns, functioning of brain and operation of a computer, production in chemical industries, manufacturing fertilisers, alkalis, acids, salts, dyes, polymers, drugs, soaps, detergents, metals, alloys, etc., including new material.\n\nChemistry contributes in a big way to the national economy. It also plays an important role in meeting human needs for food, healthcare products and other material aimed at improving the quality of life. This is exemplified by the large-scale production of a variety of fertilisers, improved variety of pesticides and insecticides. Chemistry provides methods for the isolation of lifesaving drugs from natural sources and makes possible synthesis of such drugs. Some of these drugs are **cisplatin** and **taxol**, which are effective in cancer therapy. The drug AZT (Azidothymidine) is used for helping AIDS patients.\n\nChemistry contributes to a large extent in the development and growth of a nation. With a better understanding of chemical principles it has now become possible to design and synthesise new material having specific magnetic, electric and optical properties. This has lead to the production of superconducting ceramics, conducting polymers, optical fibres, etc. Chemistry has helped in establishing industries which manufacture utility goods, like acids, alkalies, dyes, polymesr metals, etc. These industries contribute in a big way to the economy of a nation and generate employment.\n\nIn recent years, chemistry has helped in dealing with some of the pressing aspects of environmental degradation with a fair degree of success. Safer alternatives to environmentally hazardous refrigerants, like CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), responsible for ozone depletion in the stratosphere, have been successfully synthesised. However, many big environmental problems continue to be matters of grave concern to the chemists. One such problem is the management of the Green House gases, like methane, carbon dioxide, etc. Understanding of biochemical processes, use of enzymes for large-scale production of chemicals and synthesis of new exotic material are some of the intellectual challenges for the future generation of chemists. A developing country, like India, needs talented and creative chemists for accepting such challenges. To be a good chemist and to accept such challanges, one needs to understand the basic concepts of chemistry, which begin with the concept of matter. Let us start with the nature of matter.\n\n#### **",

        "page_content": "1.2 Nature of Matter** You are already familiar with the term **matter** from your earlier classes. Anything which has mass and occupies space is called **matter**. Everything around us, for example, book, pen, pencil, water, air, all living beings, etc., are composed of matter. You know that they have mass and they occupy space. Let us recall the characteristics of the states of matter, which you learnt in your previous classes. #### **1.2.1 States of Matter** You are aware that matter can exist in three physical states *viz.* **solid**, **liquid** and **gas**. The constituent particles of matter in these three states can be represented as shown in Fig. 1.1. Particles are held very close to each other in **solids** in an orderly fashion and there is not much freedom of movement. In **liquids**, the particles are close to each other but they can move around. However, in **gases**, the particles are far apart as compared to those present in solid or liquid states and their movement is easy and fast. Because of such arrangement of particles, different states of matter exhibit the following characteristics: - (i) Solids have *definite volume* and *definite shape*. - (ii) Liquids have *definite volume* but *do not* have *definite shape*. They take the shape of the container in which they are placed. Unit 1.indd 4 9/9/2022 4:27:29 PM ![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg) *Fig. 1.2 Classification of matter Fig. 1.1 Arrangement of particles in solid, liquid and gaseous state* (iii) Gases have *neither definite volume nor definite shape*. They completely occupy the space in the container in which they are placed. These three states of matter are interconvertible by changing the conditions of temperature and pressure. Solid liquid Gas On heating, a solid usually changes to a liquid, and the liquid on further heating changes to gas (or vapour). In the reverse process, a gas on cooling liquifies to the liquid and the liquid on further cooling freezes to the solid. #### **1.2.2. Classification of Matter** In Class IX (Chapter 2), you have learnt that at the macroscopic or bulk level, matter can be classified as **mixture** or **pure substance**. These can be further sub-divided as shown in Fig. 1.2. When all constituent particles of a substance are same in chemical nature, it is said to be a pure substance. A mixture contains many types of particles. **A mixture** contains particles of two or more pure substances which may be present in it in any ratio. Hence, their composition is variable. Pure substances forming mixture are called its components. Many of the substances present around you are **mixtures**. For example, sugar solution in water, air, tea, etc., are all mixtures. A mixture may be **homogeneous** or **heterogeneous**. In a **homogeneous mixture**, the components ![](_page_4_Figure_11.jpeg) completely mix with each other. This means particles of components of the mixture are uniformly distributed throughout the bulk of the mixture and its composition is uniform throughout. Sugar solution and air are the examples of homogeneous mixtures. In contrast to this, in a **heterogeneous mixture**, the composition is not uniform throughout and sometimes different components are visible. For example, mixtures of salt and sugar, grains and pulses along with some dirt (often stone pieces), are heterogeneous mixtures. You can think of many more examples of mixtures which you come across in the daily life. It is worthwhile to mention here that the components of a mixture can be separated by using physical methods, such as simple hand-picking, filtration, crystallisation, distillation, etc. **Pure substances** have characteristics different from mixtures. Constituent particles of pure substances have fixed composition. Copper, silver, gold, water and glucose are some examples of pure substances. Glucose contains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in a fixed ratio and its particles are of same composition. Hence, like all other pure substances, glucose has a fixed composition. Also, its constituents—carbon, hydrogen and oxygen—cannot be separated by simple physical methods. Pure substances can further be classified into **elements** and **compounds**. Particles of an **element** consist of only one type of atoms. These particles may exist as **atoms** or **molecules**. You may be familiar with atoms Unit 1.indd 5 9/9/2022 4:27:30 PM 6 chemistry and molecules from the previous classes; however, you will be studying about them in detail in Unit 2. Sodium, copper, silver, hydrogen, oxygen, etc., are some examples of elements. Their",

        "page_content": "all atoms are of one type. However, the atoms of different elements are different in nature. Some elements, such as sodium or copper, contain atoms as their constituent particles, whereas, in some others, the constituent particles are molecules which are formed by two or more atoms. For example, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen gases consist of molecules, in which two atoms combine to give their respective molecules. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.3. ![](_page_5_Figure_2.jpeg) *Fig. 1.3 A representation of atoms and molecules* When two or more atoms of different elements combine together in a definite ratio, the molecule of a **compound** is obtained. Moreover, the constituents of a compound cannot be separated into simpler substances by physical methods. They can be separated by chemical methods. Examples of some compounds are water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, sugar, etc. The molecules of water and carbon dioxide are represented in Fig. 1.4. Note that a water molecule comprises two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Similarly, a molecule of carbon dioxide contains two oxygen atoms combined with one carbon atom. Thus, the atoms of different ![](_page_5_Figure_6.jpeg) *Fig. 1.4 A depiction of molecules of water and carbon dioxide* elements are present in a compound in a fixed and definite ratio and this ratio is characteristic of a particular compound. Also, the properties of a compound are different from those of its constituent elements. For example, hydrogen and oxygen are gases, whereas, the compound formed by their combination i.e., water is a liquid. It is interesting to note that hydrogen burns with a pop sound and oxygen is a supporter of combustion, but water is used as a fire extinguisher. # ** 1.3 Properties of Matter and their Measurement**\n\n#### **1.3.1 Physical and chemical properties**\n\nEvery substance has unique or characteristic properties. These properties can be classified into two categories — **physical properties,** such as colour, odour, melting point, boiling point, density, etc., and **chemical properties,** like composition, combustibility, ractivity with acids and bases, etc.\n\n**Physical properties** can be measured or observed without changing the identity or the composition of the substance. The measurement or observation of **chemical properties** requires a chemical change to occur. Measurement of physical properties does not require occurance of a chemical change. The examples of chemical properties are characteristic reactions of different substances; these include acidity or basicity, combustibility, etc. Chemists describe, interpret and predict the behaviour of substances on the basis of knowledge of their physical and chemical properties, which are determined by careful measurement and experimentation. In the following section, we\n\nUnit 1.indd 6 9/9/2022 4:27:30 PM\n\nwill learn about the measurement of physical properties.\n\n#### **1.3.2 Measurement of physical properties**\n\nQuantitative measurement of properties is reaquired for scientific investigation. Many properties of matter, such as length, area, volume, etc., are quantitative in nature. Any quantitative observation or measurement is represented by a number followed by units in which it is measured. For example, length of a room can be represented as 6 m; here, 6 is the number and m denotes metre, the unit in which the length is measured.\n\nEarlier, two different systems of measurement, i.e., the **English System**  and the **Metric System** were being used in different parts of the world. The metric system, which originated in France in late eighteenth century, was more convenient as it was based on the decimal system. Late, need of a common standard system was felt by the scientific community. Such a system was established in 1960 and is discussed in detail below.\n\n#### **",

The CGPM is an inter- #### **Maintaining the National Standards of Measurement** The system of units, including unit definitions, keeps on changing with time. Whenever the accuracy of measurement of a particular unit was enhanced substantially by adopting new principles, member nations of metre treaty (signed in 1875), agreed to change the formal definition of that unit. Each modern industrialised country, including India, has a National Metrology Institute (NMI), which maintains standards of measurements. This responsibility has been given to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi. This laboratory establishes experiments to realise the *base units* and *derived units* of measurement and maintains National Standards of Measurement. These standards are periodically inter-compared with standards maintained at other National Metrology Institutes in the world, as well as those, established at the International Bureau of Standards in Paris. governmental treaty organisation created by a diplomatic treaty known as Metre Convention, which was signed in Paris in 1875. **The SI system has seven** *base units* and they are listed in Table 1.1.

The chemical energy may also be used to do mechanical work when a fuel burns in an engine or to provide electrical energy through a galvanic cell like dry cell. Thus, various forms of energy are interrelated and under certain conditions, these may be transformed from one form into another. The study of these energy transformations forms the subject matter of thermodynamics. The laws of thermodynamics deal with energy changes of macroscopic systems involving a large number of molecules rather than microscopic systems containing a few molecules. Thermodynamics is not concerned about how and at what rate these energy transformations are carried out, but is based on initial and final states of a system undergoing the change. Laws of thermodynamics apply only when a system is in equilibrium or moves from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium state. Macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature do not change with time for a system in equilibrium state. In this unit, we would like to answer some of the important questions through thermodynamics, like:\n\n*How do we determine the energy changes involved in a chemical reaction/process? Will it occur or not?*\n\n*What drives a chemical reaction/process?*\n\n*To what extent do the chemical reactions proceed?*\n\nUnit 5.indd 136 9/12/2022 11:53:33 AM\n\n# **",

        "page_content": "5.1.2 Types of the System** We, further classify the systems according to the movements of matter and energy in or out of the system. # *1. Open System* In an open system, there is exchange of energy and matter between system and surroundings [Fig. 5.2 (a)]. The presence of reactants in an open beaker is an example of an open system\\*. Here the boundary is an imaginary surface enclosing the beaker and reactants. # *2. Closed System* In a closed system, there is no exchange of matter, but exchange of energy is possible between system and the surroundings [Fig. 5.2 (b)]. The presence of reactants in a closed vessel made of conducting material e.g., copper or steel is an example of a closed system. ![](_page_1_Figure_18.jpeg) *\\* We could have chosen only the reactants as system then walls of the beakers will act as boundary.* Unit 5.indd 137 9/12/2022 11:53:34 AM #### *3. Isolated System* In an isolated system, there is no exchange of energy or matter between the system and the surroundings [Fig. 5.2 (c)]. The presence of reactants in a thermos flask or any other closed insulated vessel is an example of an isolated system. #### **5.1.3 The State of the System** The system must be described in order to make any useful calculations by specifying quantitatively each of the properties such as its pressure (*p*), volume (*V*), and temperature (*T* ) as well as the composition of the system. We need to describe the system by specifying it before and after the change. You would recall from your Physics course that the state of a system in mechanics is completely specified at a given instant of time, by the position and velocity of each mass point of the system. In thermodynamics, a different and much simpler concept of the state of a system is introduced. It does not need detailed knowledge of motion of each particle because, we deal with average measurable properties of the system. We specify the state of the system by **state functions** or **state variables**. The **state** of a thermodynamic system is described by its measurable or macroscopic (bulk) properties. We can describe the state of a gas by quoting its pressure (*p*), volume (*V*), temperature (*T* ), amount (*n*) etc. Variables like *p*, *V*, *T* are called **state variables** or **state functions** because their values depend only on the state of the system and not on how it is reached. In order to completely define the state of a system it is not necessary to define all the properties of the system; as only a certain number of properties can be varied independently. This number depends on the nature of the system. Once these minimum number of macroscopic properties are fixed, others automatically have definite values. The state of the surroundings can never be completely specified; fortunately it is not necessary to do so. # **5.1.4 The Internal Energy as a State Function** When we talk about our chemical system losing or gaining energy, we need to introduce a quantity which represents the total energy of the system. It may be chemical, electrical, mechanical or any other type of energy you may think of, the sum of all these is the energy of the system. In thermodynamics, we call it the internal energy, *U* of the system, which may change, when - • heat passes into or out of the system, - • work is done on or by the system, - • matter enters or leaves the system. These systems are classified accordingly as you have already studied in section 5.1.2. #### *(a) Work* Let us first examine a change in internal energy by doing work. We take a system containing some quantity of water in a thermos flask or in an insulated beaker. This would not allow exchange of heat between the system and surroundings through its boundary and we call this type of system as **adiabatic**. The manner in which the state of such a system may be changed will be called adiabatic process. Adiabatic process is a process in which there is no transfer of heat between the system and surroundings. Here, the wall separating the system and the surroundings is called the adiabatic wall (Fig. 5.3). ![](_page_2_Figure_16.jpeg) ![](_page_2_Figure_17.jpeg) Let us bring the change in the internal energy of the system by doing some work on",

        "page_content": "it. Let us call the initial state of the system as state A and its temperature as *T*A. Let the internal energy of the system in state A be called *U*A. We can change the state of the system in two different ways. Unit 5.indd 138 9/12/2022 11:53:36 AM #### THERMODYNAMICS 139 *One way:* We do some mechanical work, say 1 kJ, by rotating a set of small paddles and thereby churning water. Let the new state be called B state and its temperature, as *T*B. It is found that *T*B > *T*A and the change in temperature, ∆*T* = *T*B–*T*A. Let the internal energy of the system in state B be *U*B and the change in internal energy, ∆*U* =*U*B– *U*A. *Second way:* We now do an equal amount (i.e., 1kJ) electrical work with the help of an immersion rod and note down the temperature change. We find that the change in temperature is same as in the earlier case, say, *T*B – *T*A. In fact, the experiments in the above manner were done by J. P. Joule between 1840–50 and he was able to show that a given amount of work done on the system, no matter how it was done (irrespective of path) produced the same change of state, as measured by the change in the temperature of the system. So, it seems appropriate to define a quantity, the internal energy *U*, whose value is characteristic of the state of a system, whereby the adiabatic work, wad required to bring about a change of state is equal to the difference between the value of *U* in one state and that in another state, ∆*U i.e.,* ∆*U =U*2 *–U*1*=* wad Therefore, internal energy, *U*, of the system is a state function. By conventions of IUPAC in chemical thermodynamics. The positive sign expresses that wad is positive when work is done **on** the system and the internal energy of system increases. Similarly, if the work is done **by** the system, wad will be negative because internal energy of the system decreases. Can you name some other familiar state functions? Some of other familiar state functions are *V*, *p*, and *T*. For example, if we bring a change in temperature of the system from 25°C to 35°C, the change in temperature is 35°C–25°C = +10°C, whether we go straight up to 35°C or we cool the system for a few degrees, then take the system to the final temperature. Thus, *T* is a state function and the change in temperature is independent of the route taken. Volume of water in a pond, for example, is a state function, because change in volume of its water is independent of the route by which water is filled in the pond, either by rain or by tubewell or by both. #### *(b) Heat* We can also change the internal energy of a system by transfer of heat from the surroundings to the system or vice-versa without expenditure of work. This exchange of energy, which is a result of temperature difference is called heat, *q*. Let us consider bringing about the same change in temperature (the same initial and final states as before in section 5.1.4 (a) by transfer of heat through thermally conducting walls instead of adiabatic walls (Fig. 5.4). ![](_page_3_Figure_12.jpeg) *Fig. 5.4 A system which allows heat transfer through its boundary.* We take water at temperature, *T*A in a container having thermally conducting walls, say made up of copper and enclose it in a huge heat reservoir at temperature, *T*B. The heat absorbed by the system (water), *q* can be measured in terms of temperature difference, *T*B – *T*A. In this case change in internal energy, ∆*U* = *q*, when no work is done at constant volume. *By conventions of IUPAC in chemical thermodynamics. The q is positive, when heat is transferred from the surroundings to the system and the internal energy of the system increases and q is negative when heat is transferred from system to the surroundings resulting in decrease of the internal energy of the system.* Unit 5.indd 139 9/12/2022 11:53:37 AM *`<sup>`\\*`</sup>` Earlier negative sign was assigned when the work is done on the system and positive sign when the work is done by the system.

        "page_content": "5.1 Thermodynamic terms**\n\nWe are interested in chemical reactions and the energy changes accompanying them. For this we need to know certain thermodynamic terms. These are discussed below.\n\n# ** 5.1.1 The System and the Surroundings**\n\nA **system** in thermodynamics refers to that part of universe in which observations are made and remaining universe constitutes the **surroundings.** The surroundings include everything other than the system. System and the surroundings together constitute the universe.\n\nThe universe = The system + The surroundings\n\nHowever, the entire universe other than the system is not affected by the changes taking place in the system. Therefore, for all practical purposes, the surroundings are that portion of the remaining universe which can interact with the system. Usually, the region of space in the neighbourhood of the system constitutes its surroundings.\n\nFor example, if we are studying the reaction between two substances A and B kept in a beaker, the beaker containing the reaction mixture is the system and the room where the beaker is kept is the surroundings (Fig. 5.1).\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\n*Fig. 5.1 System and the surroundings*\n\nNote that the system may be defined by physical boundaries, like beaker or test tube, or the system may simply be defined by a set of Cartesian coordinates specifying a particular volume in space. It is necessary to think of the system as separated from the surroundings by some sort of wall which may be real or imaginary. The wall that separates the system from the surroundings is called **boundary**. This is designed to allow us to control and keep track of all movements of matter and energy in or out of the system.\n\n### ** followed in physics books, although IUPAC has recommended the use of new sign convention.* # *(c) The general case* Let us consider the general case in which a change of state is brought about both by doing work and by transfer of heat. We write change in internal energy for this case as: $$ \\Delta U = q \\,\\,\\,+\\,\\,\\,\\text{w} \\tag{5.1} $$ For a given change in state, *q* and w can vary depending on how the change is carried out. However, *q* +w = ∆*U* will depend only on initial and final state. It will be independent of the way the change is carried out. If there is no transfer of energy as heat or as work (isolated system) i.e., if w = 0 and *q* = 0, then ∆ *U* = 0. The equation 5.1 i.e., ∆*U* = *q* + w is mathematical statement of the **first law of thermodynamics**, which states that # *The energy of an isolated system is constant.* It is commonly stated as the law of conservation of energy i.e., energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. **Note:** There is considerable difference between the character of the thermodynamic property energy and that of a mechanical property such as volume. We can specify an unambiguous (absolute) value for volume of a system in a particular state, but not the absolute value of the internal energy. However, we can measure only the changes in the internal energy, ∆*U* of the system. ## **",
